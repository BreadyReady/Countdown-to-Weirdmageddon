 POLITICS_GREEN_DESC:0 "The Governor of California.\n\nAs he approches the end of his 4th term as governor, he holds the title as being both the youngest governor in his first two terms and the oldest governor in his last two terms in Californian history. As he returned to the governorship due to the Wilson Fiasco nearly a decades ago, his term is ending outside of the normal election cycle.\n\nNone the less, many political analysis have called the off month election to his appointed successor, San Francisco Mayor Travis Olson.\n\nAs the senior of the West Coast Governors, Green is prepared to lead and ready California and western states through any emergency inspite of his remaining time in office. It will be his intial descions that could very well decide California's fate."

 POLITICS_HECTOR_DESC:0 "The Lieutenant Governor of California.\n\nOnce a decorated government agent in another life, Hector Diaz-Guzman was a man more than content in spending his early retirment in the late 80s in peace with his brother's family in Southern California. But it was after his brother's death in the LA Riot of '92 that mark his entrance into poltics. With a natural charisma, a fierce rhetoric, and the backing of some secret government agencies, he soon went from a Echo County councilman, to Mayor of Los Angeles, before winning the race as the first openly gay Lieutenant Governor of California in 2008 with the full backing of the SoCal New Democratic-Republican Party.\n\nSince than, Hector has all but assumed the role as the leader of Southern California since the 2000s, especially after being snubbed for the California NDR's nomintion for the next governoral canidate in late 2011. However, political trouble is the last thing in his mind. With the new challanges California itself now face on the eve of "The Long Summer", his secret past is about to catch up to him and those close to him."
 
 #Oregon#####################################################################
 POLITICS_ONYX_DESC:0 "The Governor of Oregon.\n\nHer rise to the governorship has been a turbulant one. Formerly a senator, her popularity has been divided between the Willamette Valley and the rest of Oregon. Many in the Oregon NDR were surprised she managed to secured any nomination for any postion in Oregon, let alone the nomination for Governor for the liberal branch of the New Democratic-Republicans. Her victory for the governorship during the tight race was thanks to a freak encounter where an eagle attacked her in Gravity Falls and the locals mistook it as a sign she was suppose to be the new governor. Roadkill County's votes may have gavin her her new job, but she leads a state divided in view of her and very uneasy to everything around."

 POLITICS_CHIU_DESC:0 "The Secretary of State of Oregon.\n\nThere is a clearly detailed record of Andrew Chiu's early life before the FPI. Anyone in the know can tell that it means his real backstory, similar to Hector's, is a secret almost equal to what they worked on together. Once the FPI's premier agent in the 60s, Operation Hercules and the FPI/MI-13 split still haunt him. Even before his retirment in the 80s, he had essentially checked out of the FPI, starting a family in Gravity Falls at the insistance of Director B. After he left officially, his entrence into poltics was more on a dare by his "friend" in California than any real interest in open civil service.\n\nIt was his time as a senator he met Onyx who rekidled his old passion in politics and when many saw Onyx's governorship as a disaster awaiting to happen, his willingness to serve as Secretary of State saved her first eyar as governor."
 
 #Washington #####################################################################
 POLITICS_DAY_DESC:0 "The Governor of the State of Washington.\n\nHarold Day is a no-nonsence person. He served as a marine along side Adrian Curtis during the Cold War and later as a drill seargent until the infamous Pines Affaire that resulted in the formation of the New Democratic-Republican Party. Seeing the new political landscape, he retired from service and ran for governor in his home state, winning easily thanks then-Senator Adrian Curtis's support.\n\nStill, Day tolerates no shanigans, whether it be the normal or paranormal and has grown distance from Curtis since his controverial presidency. For his part, he has total control of his state and will fight anything he preceives as a threat to normal democracy."

 POLITICS_CURTIS_DESC:0 "The 45th President of the United States of America.\n\nPresident Curtis is the first president of the "united" New Democratic-Republicans and the first president after three one-term presidents to have won a successful second term. The second african american to hold the highest office on Earth, he entered his first term with the full optimism of the nation for a true 21st century America.\n\nInstead, his office has been marred in controversy. In eight years, he had sparked critism for consistant flipping of the issues, for his authoritarian leadership in both the White House and in dealing with Congress, and his war-like stance at a time when people want peace. Worse, his inconsistant siding with issues had destroyed any sence of moderatism in the party, with the two sides now radicalized to the far sides of the spectrum. Some claim this was deliberate, as the party is now unable to choose anyone to replace him.\n\nStill, his popularity remains low, as he is now the only president since Kennedy to not add a new state to the union within two terms. A bitter congress voted down both of his bills to welcome the Philippines back into the Union in 2006 and to "liberate" Cuba in 2010. While congress isn't bold to remove him altogther, many are worried Curtis would do the same thing to them if given the chance.\n\nAs the orignal bill to limit presidental terms failed to become an amendment in 1947, Curtis enters the election year already assured a third term, the first since FDR. It will be history in the end to judge his leadership during "The Long Summer"."

 #Canada#####################################################################
 POLITICS_POUTINE_DESC:0 "The Prime Minister of Canada and the Imperial Commonwealth.\n\nHe is the son of the legandary Prime Minister Canadian Pierce Poutine, who turned Canada into a world power.\n\nFollowing in his father's footsteps, this Poutine had greater trouble dealing with the Commonwealth, let alone the internal canadian affairs he ignored for the most part. Great Britain wants to reclaim its role as leader of the IC, many of its more powerful member states are on the verge of war with each other, and the rest rely on Canada to survive and have become a drain on Canadian resources. If not for warming relationships between Europe and the Unites States, its unlikley either he or his father could lead the Commonwealth to keep the peace in the modern era. Fortunatley, only he knows that fact. As far as most are concern, he had done a decent job leading Cananda, the IC, and maintaining world peace between the US, the EU, and the internal members of the IC."
 
 POLITICS_MORGON_DESC:0 "The Premier of British Columbia.\n\nSimilar to his old friend in the US FPI, Morgan departure from the Canadian Division of MI-13 and entrance into poltics was one of intitally of aimless endevour. After Operation Hercules, he retired to his hometown of Surrey, BC. Bored however and noticing his former FPI colleagues enter poltics, he gave a shot att he local council. Before long, he became a new memebr of the main Canadian poltical arena and ended up as the Premier of BC, wining the favour of the ruling party and even the Immortal Queen due to his service in MI-13.\n\nNow that Canada is effectivley gone and the only binding element of the Imperial Commonwealth with it, Morgon finds himeself leading the remains of Canada. With his american contacts busy figting each other, he'll have to turn to his past and what remains of MI-13 to save Canada and the world."
 
 #Mexico#####################################################################
 POLITICS_MENDEZ_DESC:0 "The President of Mexico.\n\nNearing the end of his third term, he had played an important role in modernizing Mexico since the end of the Cold War. Once a poor nation, it had risen to be a true third power in North America and his reforms had stabize the nation and made it the local superpower of Central America. His real noteworthy role was in diplomacy, where he had kept Mexico from fully joining one of the three superowors of the world, but maintain good ties to benefit off all three.\n\nThough a moderate at best, he none-the-less champion progressive bills and even beat the US to implementing, an abliet weak, form of Universal Healthcare. But as his term nears an end at the start of summer, reactionary pushback has been strong and many fear Mexico's good fortune is about to come to a sudden and painful end with his presidency."

 POLITICS_A_DESC:0 "Director of the Federal Paranormal Investigations.\n\nEven within the agency, most are unware of her and Deputy Director S's history. None the less, after the internal struggle that saw many of the FPI's best agents leave and its former Director disposed, they remained to lead the agency.\n\nFor Director A, her inital intent upon becoming Director was to lead the FPI away from its troubled pass and look to the future. She had auhtorized new joint missions with the EU EIO and many inside believe she can mend the rift between the FPI and the Commonwealth MI-13 after the horrific Operation Hercules fifty years ago.\n\nThough united in outwardly apperence, many can see there is a growing rift between her and Deputy S. Its anyone guess how this would play out. The oldest agents remaining fear a repeat of the events that lead to A and S coming to power to begin with."
 
 POLITICS_S_DESC:0 "Deputy Director of the Federal Paranormal Investigations.\n\nEven within the agency, most are unware of her and Director A's history. None the less, after the internal struggle that saw many of the FPI's best agents leave and its former Director disposed, they remained to lead the agency.\n\n While the deputy directos has been supportive of A's renewal for cooperation with the EU and the IC, S has been vocal of restarting many older programs the FPI had conducted in the past, the accumulation of which was the restart of Program Multi-Bear, the monitoring and survalince of the multiverse.\n\nNaturally, this has sparked conflict between the two, arguments that has become as open secret to the agency as a whole. Given how badley it went the first time, many do find it odd that Deputy Director S wants to restart it, when some remarked she helped stop it decades ago. Some say she has her own personal interest on it and that the same also holds for Director A."
