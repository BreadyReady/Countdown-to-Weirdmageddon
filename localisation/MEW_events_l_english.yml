#Legacy of Solaria

mewni_solaria.1.t:0 "The Legacy of Solaria"
mewni_solaria.1.d:0 "300 years ago, the Late Queen Solaria Butterfly went on a grand campaign to conquer the entire dimension for Mewman Kind. She succeeded, bringing an unprecedented golden age of Mewman supremacy. If not for her death in a foul ambush, the very idea of the monsters would have become a historical footnote. Still, thanks to her, the greater Kingdom of Mewni stands!\n\nBut Mewni has been in a slow decline ever since she died, with us having to hand out land and decentralize ourselves in order to effectivley maintain control of our holdings. The intricate allainces made by Queen Solaria and her brother Prince Jushtin still stands, but it grow weaker by the day. We have even completley lost control in some reigons, shattered monster warlords in the north and south roaming about, unimpeded.\n\nHowever, we are still the dominant force in our dimension, and those monsters dont pose a major threat to out order. The water ripples left by Queen Solaria are still being felt, 300 years later!"

emergency_economics_3.1.d:0 "Sir Stabby and his cohort of knights awaited on horseback at the main docks in Port Festiva. It was the middle of the night, the shipment from the Earth dimension was due to arrive and Her Highness Queen Moon did not want the public to be openly aware of the shipment. Through the fog, the human vessel arrived. Expecting a slow wooden craft, they were greeted by a monster size ship of metal, coated black as the night and moving against the wind at fast speeds as though it wasn’t there. Stabby himself pulled out his telescope and looked to the flag at the bow of the behemoth. A white background flag with a red star and a red stripe at the bottom. Center was a bear wearing a beaver top hat. Beneath it in Terran English and coincidently Low Mewni were the words, ‘Imperial California Republic’.\n\n‘That’s the ship. A ‘gift’ from their Emperor Norton,’ Stabby remarked.\n\nHis squire, Higgs, was awe struck. ‘How did they fit this ship through a dimension tear?’ she asked.\n\nThe human representative with them smiled and answered, “We have our ways. What you call magic, we call science!’\n\nIt docked at Port Festiva’s largest mooring. As offboarding proceeded, the mewni dockmaster stood in awe of at the massive ship. The human captain complained, remarking of the ‘tiny docks’ and how they could barley moore 'the smallest cargo ship in the Imperial Merchant Navy’. With a dozen heavy duty carts lined along the docks, all pulled by top breed warnicorns, the ship’s cranes loaded up the new equipment. The new machines would go far to relieve the kingdom’s pains. But the knights seemed skeptical at best.\n\nStill, Mr. Birnbaum assured them of Earth’s aid, ‘Rest assured, Emperor Norton and the Northwest Corporation of California stands ready to help. You but merely need to ask.’\n\n‘We’ll see about that, Earth man,’ said Stabby as he signaled the convoy to move out."
