#Legacy of Solaria

mewni_solaria.1.t:0 "The Legacy of Queen Solaria"
mewni_solaria.1.d:0 "Three hundred years ago, a newly crowned Queen Solaria Butterfly rallied the numerous Mewnan kingdoms for a grand campaign. Her mission, that she proclaimed to the Butterfly kingdom on the very night of her coronation, was to bring the entire dimension of Menwi under the rule of Mewmankind. She rallied her armies, perfected the great magic of the Butterfly Line, and began a long and glorious war to crush the monster filth.\n\nShe undoubtedly succeeded, and brought about an unprecedented golden age of Mewman supremacy. Her leadership drove the monster hordes into the Underworld and the Forest of Certain Death, where they still remain fighting amongst themselves. Thanks to her keen interest in alliance building, spearheaded by her older brother, Prince Jushtin Butterfly, she gave birth to the system that stands today as the Kingdom of Mewni. And it would be her dying wish that ensured that through centuries of dynasties and political changes, the Butterfly Family would have everlasting hegemonoy over all of Mewni."

mewni_300_peace.1.d:0 "Mewni has enjoyed three hundred years of peace. There is no doubt of what was accomplished during that time. But it was not an era of "happily ever after." The whole dimension is entering a new era, political alliances are now being tested and strained. The old social order facing challenges from rapidly evolving foes. The economy has stagnated due to minimal reform, the entire economy relying on exporting the corn crop. Even the monsters, who were so utterly crushed three centuries ago, are now starting to recover.\n\n And there is of course, the odd radical and revolutionary here and there. Spewing foreign doctrines of "Freedom" and "Democracy." But they are few and far between."

butterfly_family.1.t:0 "House Butterfly"
butterfly_family.1.d:0 "The Butterfly family has ruled most of Mewni since the great Queen Solaria lead the glorious fight against the monsters and secured Mewnipendance. Having secured the Mewman’s goal of ‘Life, Safety, and Corn’, the monarchy under House Butterfly has led their kingdom, and by extension most of the Mewman race, through the golden age of Mewman peace. But not all is easy, as in the recent years the reluctance to reform has begun to show it's concequences.\n\nThe Septarian mercanary crisis, which had the current Queen Butterfly rise to the throne after her mother was killed by a monster force, almost had Mewni be plunged into war once again. However, Queen Moon protected her people and prevented the crisis from starting total war. And as a new era dawns on the Mewman dimension, everyone looks to Moon and the Butterfly family for guidance."

MEW_prolouge_end.1.t:0 "The Underestimated"
MEW_prolouge_end.1.d:0 "Princess Star of House Butterfly, heir to the Mewman throne, is not in her home dimension of Mewni. Instead, she is on Earth. In California, to be precise. This is because she had insufficiently studied her magic, and now with the Butterfly wand in her possession (Given to all Butterfly heirs at age 14,) Her ineptitude is now destructive. The last straw was the great fire of Mewni, which was caused by her on the very first day she got the wand. Thus, she will study on earth using their “Foriegn Exchange Program.” Until she can sufficiently control her magic.\n\nIt’s not all bad with her though. Politically speaking, anyway. It seems that every heir in the various Kingdoms that make up the Kingdom of Mewni are of similar age. Thus, all rulers of Mewni could be friends from childhood in the next generation. And there is of course always the possibility of an alliance through marriage."

emergency_economics_3.1.d:0 "Sir Stabby and his cohort of knights awaited on horseback at the main docks in Port Festiva. It was the middle of the night, the shipment from the Earth dimension was due to arrive and Her Highness Queen Moon did not want the public to be openly aware of the shipment. Through the fog, the human vessel arrived. Expecting a slow wooden craft, they were greeted by a monster size ship of metal, coated black as the night and moving against the wind at fast speeds as though it wasn’t there. Stabby himself pulled out his telescope and looked to the flag at the bow of the behemoth. A white background flag with a red star and a red stripe at the bottom. Center was a bear wearing a beaver top hat. Beneath it in Terran English and coincidently Low Mewni were the words, ‘Imperial California Republic’.\n\n‘That’s the ship. A ‘gift’ from their Emperor Norton,’ Stabby remarked.\n\nHis squire, Higgs, was awe struck. ‘How did they fit this ship through a dimension tear?’ she asked.\n\nThe human representative with them smiled and answered, “We have our ways. What you call magic, we call science!’\n\nIt docked at Port Festiva’s largest mooring. As offboarding proceeded, the mewni dockmaster stood in awe of at the massive ship. The human captain complained, remarking of the ‘tiny docks’ and how they could barley moore 'the smallest cargo ship in the Imperial Merchant Navy’. With a dozen heavy duty carts lined along the docks, all pulled by top breed warnicorns, the ship’s cranes loaded up the new equipment. The new machines would go far to relieve the kingdom’s pains. But the knights seemed skeptical at best.\n\nStill, Mr. Birnbaum assured them of Earth’s aid, ‘Rest assured, Emperor Norton and the Northwest Corporation of California stands ready to help. You but merely need to ask.’\n\n‘We’ll see about that, Earth man,’ said Stabby as he signaled the convoy to move out."

MEW_reform_economy_4.1.d:0 "The commission met, as usual, at the Bureaucracy of Magic. Lekmet, as the chancellor of the commission, began the meeting with a traditional speech, a few ‘baahh’s to fully commemorate the meeting. They then began in earnest.\n\nOne of the main agendas, along with the weakening of magic in the realm as of late, was Queen Moon’s new foreign policy. In the wake of reduced crop yields and widespread theft of the Butterfly Kingdom’s Corn Reserves, Moon has opted to look for foreign assistance. While many different dimensions border with Mewni, only Earth had the raw industrial and technological capability to quickly aid in modernizing Mewni’s food production. Already, Human staple crops such as wheat, rice, and tubers have surpassed current corn yields. And it has been new harvesting and canning machinery that has increased both the yield and shelf life of Mewni’s food reserves.\n\n'And their leader, Norton. I don’t trust him,’ said Rhombus.\n\nWhile the foreign aid was one issue, the more pressing one also was who was providing the aid. From the very first time they laid eyes on him, the MHC had no love for the human’s 'Emperor'. But Moon’s pressing on the issue has fallen flat. The Commission had only assured her that Joshua Norton and the human’s ‘assistance’ cannot be trusted. While Moon has her own doubts about the motives of the humans, outright rejection of aid so freely given to them would easily prove suicidal.\n\nWith Moon still ultimately in her right as Queen to decide, the Commission expected an answer from her on her plans moving forward."

This could not be tolerated, we are in an industrial crisis after all! And so the Royal Guard was sent in to dissapate the riot and send everyone back to work.\n\nHowever, the protesters were steadfast, unwilling to go back to work. They chanted anti-Butterfly slogans and waved their protest signs wildly. One thing led to another, and the guards had no choice but to draw their weapons and spill blood.\n\nThe day ended in 3 deaths, 1 guard and 2 protesters."

It's just… this sparring session?’\n\nQueen Moon and King River entered the main sparing courtyard. The combat zone had a soft cushion platform, lightly covered in sand. Both in their armored suits, they took their end of the court.\n\n‘Our dear baby Star, and your accursed aunt, may think I’m an old man. But I am a Johansen! We are warriors of Mewni! Foolduke! My sword!’ They both watched as a white monkey brandishing River’s sword with its tail ran across the courtyard as Foolduck chased it, keeping her distance from the sharp end of the sword. ‘That monkey will pay for it’s treason,’ a guard walked over and handed River a sword to use instead, ‘Now my sweet Moonpie… En Garde!’\n\nHe charged forward, thrusting at her. Moon quickly entered her Mewberty form and flew back to dodge. With her primary arms, she charged up some weakened energy bolts and fired at River, careful to only hit just next to him. Rivers attempted to dodge, only to promptly stagger into each blast instead. He shrugged it off and kept his sight locked on Moon as she flew around him. He reached for his sides and pulled out three heavy concrete disks. He took to stance and spun about before he threw the disk at her at high speed. She dodged the first with a quick side shuffle, and then raised her hand to blast away the second one. The dust from the second disk obscured her sight and before she could move away, the third disk came flying through the dust and hit her center mass.\n\nMoon was taken by surprise by the hit, nearly falling backwards before she immediately regained her flying stance. Instinctually , she fully charged her magic and unleashed a full energy blast at River. He jumped out of the way, carried onward by the shockwave as a large crater formed in the center of the yard. Realizing what she did, she rushed back down to check on River.\n\nShe knelt down and removed his helmet. ‘Are you alright, River?’\n\nHe replied, small stars circling around him, ‘Fine fine, my dear. Just... I just have to catch my breath.’\n\nShe smiled, “I think we had enough sparring for today,’ she kissed him on the cheek, ‘Thanks for the training, dear.’\n\n‘Of course Moonpie,’ he laid his head back down on the ground, ‘Always happy to help.’"

Once upon a time, the Avarius family line reigned as the official ruling monarchs of the monsters in Mewni, an ingenious ploy by Queen Crescenta Butterfly to create a more tolerable monster state, under the direct influence on Mewni. Given the obvious manipulating nature of the election, few monsters sided with the new monarch and the resulting Avarius Kingdom consisted only of the hills between the Forest of Certain Death and the Jaggy Mountains, as well as a Butterfly controlled part of the FCD near Stallward Valley.\n\nEver since their son Ludo locked them out of their own castle, the very one which was later destroyed by Star, the family had taken refuge in their vacation home in the FCD. Standing at the door, the first greetings between Lord Brudo and Queen Moon was less than welcoming, though he begrudgingly welcomed her in. With a gift of corn from Moon that was partially welcomed, Moon asked Lady Avarius.\n\n‘So, what brings you here, Queen Moon?’\n\n‘I’m here because your son took a very important book from my family.’\n\n‘My son? Crudo?’ ‘Uh, no.’ ‘Yudo?’ ‘Isn’t she your daughter?’ ‘Menudo?’ ‘Nope’ ‘Okay, I’m just gonna go down the list. Dudo, Kudo, Mudo, Tudo, Fudo, Zudo, Udo... Not Dennis!?’\n\nMoon clarified. She was looking for Ludo. But the very name wasn’t welcomed in their house. Ludo was the runt of a son that disappointed their family, stole their home and got it destroyed. They knew nothing, and had no real intentions to learn of Ludo’s where-about. Acknowledging that dead end, she departed.\n\nBut as she made her way back through the forest, she quickly noticed someone lurking throughout the tree line, quickly following along her path."

From his magic hand, his magic energy grabbed hold of her arm and seismic tossed her into the ground. As Ludo absorbed her soul, Rhombus came back, firing off a hail of crystals at Ludo. As Lekmet used his own energy to restore Hekapoo, Ludo dispatched Rhombus once more, this time absorbing his soul as well.\n\nHekapoo rushed back into the fight as Lekmet restored Rhombus. Withering away up, Rhombus warned Lekmet  that he couldn’t keep doing that as his own energy force was deleted in the act.

Her first sight would be of Lekmet turning to dust.\n\n‘Chancellor, no!’\n\n‘Hello, Moon. It's been a while...’ he showed his hand and the missing finger on it.\n\n‘Toffee!’\n\nMoon fired off a series of energy blasts at Toffee, who quickly brushed them off with an energy wave. A blur of blue and green filled the temple as they battled, but even in full mewberty form, Moon was quickly bested by Ludo encased Toffee. Before he could go for the kill, Moon let out a huge energy blast, taking out a quarter of the temple in the process.\n\nIn the confusion, Moon gathered the bodies of the commission and opened a portal to retreat. As she was about to leave, Toffee slowly hovered towards her.\n\n‘Tell Star...’"

trade_ports.1.d:0 "A proposal from the new human embassy has arrived. Given the current situation in Mewni, the newly declared Human State known as the Imperial California Republic under their Emperor Norton wishes to assist in maintaining stability in the kingdom. Specificly outlined, they wish we transfer control of a stript of land bordering Lake Mewni to them. It's purpose would be to construct a base to manage human forces in Mewni and to protect our southwestern border from the recent collapse of the Musty Kingdom. It would officially be temporarily, but realisiticly they shall hold on to the land for the foreseeable future. In return, the humans will offer major assisatnce in our manufactoring capability and will also send aid in fuel and food, which we could make good use of.\n\nMany in the court are hesitant, however. The land they wish to occupy is known as Solaria's Folly, where the great Queen Solaria was ambushed and slained. The site has some significants to the hardliners in the court and transfering contorl to the land, let alone letting it be turned into a base by foreigners is not popular. But apperently this was intentional and Norton himself insist on the site. He even claimed it's what Solaria herself would have wanted. This has angered the court all around, but the humans will not budge on this. Of course, Queen Moon shall make the final decision.\n\n'The deal is certainly sweet, but the aftertaste won't be liked by many...'"
