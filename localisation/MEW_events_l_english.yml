#Legacy of Solaria

mewni_solaria.1.t:0 "The Legacy of Queen Solaria"
mewni_solaria.1.d:0 "Three hundred years ago, a newly crowned Queen Solaria Butterfly rallied the numerous Mewnan kingdoms for a grand campaign. Her mission, that she proclaimed to the Butterfly kingdom on the very night of her coronation, was to bring the entire dimension of Menwi under the rule of Mewmankind. She rallied her armies, perfected the great magic of the Butterfly Line, and began a long and glorious war to crush the monster filth.\n\nShe undoubtedly succeeded, and brought about an unprecedented golden age of Mewman supremacy. Her leadership drove the monster hordes into the Underworld and the Forest of Certain Death, where they still remain fighting amongst themselves. Thanks to her keen interest in alliance building, spearheaded by her older brother, Prince Jushtin Butterfly, she gave birth to the system that stands today as the Kingdom of Mewni. And it would be her dying wish that ensured that through centuries of dynasties and political changes, the Butterfly Family would have everlasting hegemonoy over all of Mewni."
mewni_solaria.1.a:0 "Rest in peace, Monster Carver"

mewni_300_peace.1.t:0 "300 Years of Peace"
mewni_300_peace.1.d:0 "Mewni has enjoyed three hundred years of peace. There is no doubt of what was accomplished during that time. But it was not an era of "happily ever after." The whole dimension is entering a new era, political alliances are now being tested and strained. The old social order facing challenges from rapidly evolving foes. The economy has stagnated due to minimal reform, the entire economy relying on exporting the corn crop. Even the monsters, who were so utterly crushed three centuries ago, are now starting to recover.\n\n And there is of course, the odd radical and revolutionary here and there. Spewing foreign doctrines of "Freedom" and "Democracy." But they are few and far between."
mewni_300_peace.1.a:0 "As the Earth saying goes, "We live in interesting times.""

butterfly_family.1.t:0 "House Butterfly"
butterfly_family.1.d:0 "The Butterfly family has ruled most of Mewni since the great Queen Solaria lead the glorious fight against the monsters and secured Mewnipendance. Having secured the Mewman’s goal of ‘Life, Safety, and Corn’, the monarchy under House Butterfly has led their kingdom, and by extension most of the Mewman race, through the golden age of Mewman peace. But not all is easy, as in the recent years the reluctance to reform has begun to show it's concequences.\n\nThe Septarian mercanary crisis, which had the current Queen Butterfly rise to the throne after her mother was killed by a monster force, almost had Mewni be plunged into war once again. However, Queen Moon protected her people and prevented the crisis from starting total war. And as a new era dawns on the Mewman dimension, everyone looks to Moon and the Butterfly family for guidance."
butterfly_family.1.a:0 "A notable exception though, is Star."

MEW_prolouge_end.1.t:0 "The Underestimated"
MEW_prolouge_end.1.d:0 "Princess Star of House Butterfly, heir to the Mewman throne, is not in her home dimension of Mewni. Instead, she is on Earth. In California, to be precise. This is because she had insufficiently studied her magic, and now with the Butterfly wand in her possession (Given to all mewman heirs at age 14,) Her ineptitude is now destructive. The last straw was the great fire of Mewni, which was caused by her on the very first day she got the wand. Thus, she will study on earth using their “Foriegn Exchange Program.” Until she can sufficiently control her magic.\n\nIt’s not all bad with her though. Politically speaking, anyway. It seems that every heir in the various Kingdoms that make up the Kingdom of Mewni are of similar age. Thus, all rulers of Mewni could be friends from childhood in the next generation. And there is of course always the possibility of an alliance through marriage."
MEW_prolouge_end.1.a:0 "However, they still call her "The Underestimated" for a reason."

emergency_economics_3.1.t:0 "Strange Imports From A Strange Land"
emergency_economics_3.1.d:0 "Sir Stabby and his cohort of knights awaited on horseback at the main docks in Port Festiva. It was the middle of the night, the shipment from the Earth dimension was due to arrive and Her Highness Queen Moon did not want the public to be openly aware of the shipment. Through the fog, the human vessel arrived. Expecting a slow wooden craft, they were greeted by a monster size ship of metal, coated black as the night and moving against the wind at fast speeds as though it wasn’t there. Stabby himself pulled out his telescope and looked to the flag at the bow of the behemoth. A white background flag with a red star and a red stripe at the bottom. Center was a bear wearing a beaver top hat. Beneath it in Terran English and coincidently Low Mewni were the words, ‘Imperial California Republic’.\n\n‘That’s the ship. A ‘gift’ from their Emperor Norton,’ Stabby remarked.\n\nHis squire, Higgs, was awe struck. ‘How did they fit this ship through a dimension tear?’ she asked.\n\nThe human representative with them smiled and answered, “We have our ways. What you call magic, we call science!’\n\nIt docked at Port Festiva’s largest mooring. As offboarding proceeded, the mewni dockmaster stood in awe of at the massive ship. The human captain complained, remarking of the ‘tiny docks’ and how they could barley moore 'the smallest cargo ship in the Imperial Merchant Navy’. With a dozen heavy duty carts lined along the docks, all pulled by top breed warnicorns, the ship’s cranes loaded up the new equipment. The new machines would go far to relieve the kingdom’s pains. But the knights seemed skeptical at best.\n\nStill, Mr. Birnbaum assured them of Earth’s aid, ‘Rest assured, Emperor Norton and the Northwest Corporation of California stands ready to help. You but merely need to ask.’\n\n‘We’ll see about that, Earth man,’ said Stabby as he signaled the convoy to move out."
