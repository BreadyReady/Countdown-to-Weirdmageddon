tsr_alliance_proposal.1.t:0 "The Mewmans Propose An Alliance"
tsr_alliance_proposal.1.d:0 "The recent civil strife in the Kingdom of Mewni is growing more and more desperate, and as the fate of the Mewman state hangs in the balance we have been given a unique oppurtunity. A Mewman delegate has come to the cream-lin, and is asking for our support in the inevitable conflict. \nOn one hand, if we side with Mewni and they win, we would be seen in great favor by them. We might even be formally entered into the Kingdom of Mewni, being given the same privleges as the other monster kingdoms underneath them. On the other hand, we would be serving our historical oppressers, who we only knelt to in the past for our own survival."
tsr_alliance_proposal.1.a:0 "History has shown us that we are perfect partners to the Mewman, we accept!"
tsr_alliance_proposal.2.a:0 "This is too much of a risk, we are staying out of the war."

tsr_wants_land.1.d:0 "Our delegation to the Monster Tsardom has returned with news: The monsters will support us in the coming conflict, as long as they get the reigons of Boggabah and the Greater Plains. As the Johansen Kingdom recognizes us as their superior, we have ultimate say in this matter despite Boggabah being owned by them. Although this problem may arise in the future once we win the civil war and we are no longer united by a common enemy. \n\nHow should we respond?"
tsr_wants_land.1.a:0 "Your terms are acceptable. Welcome to the Butterfly Front!"
tsr_wants_land.2.a:0 "Those lands are important pieces of Mewman pride. Your terms are unnacaptable."

tsr_land_alliance_accepted.1.t:0 "The Land Exchange Is Approved!"
tsr_land_alliance_accepted.1.d:0 "The land exchange has been approved, we are now part of the Butterfly Front!"

tsr_land_alliance_accepted_joh.1.t:0 "A Northern Monster Takes Boggabah!"
tsr_land_alliance_accepted_joh.1.d:0 "In a deal that we were not made aware of, a monster warlord has taken controll of Boggabah. Apparently, the Queen made a deal with this so called "Tsar" to trade some of our land in exchange for their support in the coming conflict."
tsr_land_alliance_accepted_joh.1.a:0 "Queen knows best, I guess..."

tsr_land_alliance_rejected_joh.1.a:0 "Big mcthankies from mcspankies"

uneasy_peace.1.t:0 "The Uneasy Peace"
uneasy_peace.1.d:0 "Along the border between Ludo's Loyalists and Moon's resistance, guards on each side exchange tense glances and stares. Most soldiers on both sides have never seen combat, the most one could have ever seen would be a bar brawl. Almost all are hesitant to break the 300 years of peace, and both sides don't want to be labeled as the one who broke it."
uneasy_peace.1.a:0 "Good, it gives us more time to prepare."

ludo_surrender.2.t:0 "End Of The Open Beta"
ludo_surrender.2.d:0 "With Ludo Defeated, Moon Butterfly looks out at the mess before her. The 300 year hegemony has finally been broken, the remnants warping the Kingdom of Mewni into the Butterfly Front. Moon will have to use everything at her disposal to reunite the Kingdom, and even that might not be enough. The road ahead will be long and hard, and that's not even mentioning the interdimensional forces that might intervene. The future, however certain and predictable it seemed to be before, is now a pitch black void.\n\nYou have reached the end of the Open Beta. We hope you enjoyed v0.01 of Countdown to Weirdmaggedon!
