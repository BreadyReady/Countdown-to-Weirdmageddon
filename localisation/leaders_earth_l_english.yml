 POLITICS_HECTOR_DESC:0 "The Lieutenant Governor of California, former Mayor of Los Angeles, and a once decorated FPI agent in another life, Hector Diaz-Guzman was a man more than content in spending the early twilight years of his life exploring state politics and being close to his family, like his nephew Rafael in Echo County.\n\nContray to that, Guzman has all but assumed the role as the leader of Southern California since the 2000s, especially after being snubbed for the California NDR's nomation for the next governoral canidate in late 2011.\n\nHOwever, political trouble is the least in his mind. With the fall of the US and the resurgance of paranormal activity, acculmating with Norton's election and offical First Contact with the Kingdom of Mewni, Guzman would have to face a part of his life he thought he left behind."
