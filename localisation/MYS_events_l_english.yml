    mystery_shack.2.t:0 "A Man of Mystery"
    mystery_shack.2.d:0 "There once was a man, not unlike me, who lived in this old, run-down shack. Smart, a genius really, if not also a bit of a stuck-up idiot at times. But standing in front of this invention of his, its humbling really. This was his achievement of a lifetime, a gateway to the universe and beyond. Its was his rise and because of me, it would be his fall.\n\nThirty years ago, that man was lost from our world, sucked up by the portal and into parts unknown. He was gone and I have labored since. To repair, to rebuild, to reinvent what I had thought anyway was the product of his mind. In his lost, I was changed to a new man. In my lost, he became known as a changed man. Across all the universe, across countless dimensions and realms that go beyond human comprehension, my quest to bring him back had led me to find more about myself. In that portal, I felt reborn, I felt broken, I stood on the shoulders of gods, and I saw where I really laid among the vast infinity.\n\nMaybe nothing has changed. But as that man once said, even in an isolated environment, nothing stays the same. I am not the man they think I am. I am not who I seem to be."

It says somthing that the only permanent staff Stan ever had was Soos, who he hired ten years ago when Soos was a kid. Still, even the great 'Man of Mystery' can't do every task in the Mystery Shack.\n\n'Now than. Wendy, right?'\n\n'That's my name. Don't wear it out, Mr. Pines.'\n\n'Yah, right.. so how did you hear about this open position?'\n\n'My old man wanted me to get a summer job. Told me the shack he built as a kid was hiring.'\n\n'Dan built this place? I mean, oh yes, of course. It was a long time ago. Cutting to the chase, why should I hire you?'\n\n'Well, actually, I've already completed Advance Algebra so I'm good with counting. I'm skilled with an axe and know how to use it, like say on would-be stick up artists. And you already interviewed all my friends.'\n\n'So you're the only compentant person to apply than? (And you got farther in school than I ever did)...'"

It’s been all that everyone is talking about here in California.’ \n\n‘Now Eugene, look. I love the two pipsqueaks as much as you and your sis, but you think spending the whole summer up in Oregon would be the best.’ \n\n‘Well hey now, I remember our trip to Gravity Falls when Emily and I were kids. The encompassing forest of Cascadia, the clean fresh air, the friendly locals-’ \n\n‘‘Friendly’ Locals? These chumps?’ \n\n'Haha, you really have been there for over thirty years. I would have presumed you made friends, what with running the world-famous Mystery Shack.’ \n\n‘The people of this town are weirder than anything in my shack.’ \n\n‘Yes, well. Look Uncle Stan. With the kids nearing their teenage years and high school, this may be one of the last free summers they'll have to explore the world around them. They won’t get that here in Peidmont. But with you in Gravity Falls, they can get that one last great adventure. I’m sure of it.’ \n\n‘Well... ah heck, fine. Send the youngers over. If they want a great summer, they’ll get one! With their good old Grunkle Stan!’ \n\n‘That’s great! Thanks Uncle Stanford. It’ll be a blast! They can have the same adventures that you and Uncle Stanley had that dad told me about- Wait, I mean-‘\n\n‘Stanley...’\n\n‘I’m sorry, I-’\n\n‘What? Don’t mind me, Eugene. You never even met him. Stanley is gone... But your Uncle Stanford is alive and kicking!’"
