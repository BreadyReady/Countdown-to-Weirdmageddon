    mystery_shack.2.d:0 "There once was a man, not unlike me, who lived in this old, run-down shack. Smart, a genius really, if not also a bit of a stuck-up idiot at times. But standing in front of this invention of his, its humbling really. This was his achievement of a lifetime, a gateway to the universe and beyond. Its was his rise and because of me, it would be his fall.\n\nThirty years ago, that man was lost from our world, sucked up by the portal and into parts unknown. He was gone and I have labored since. To repair, to rebuild, to reinvent what I had thought anyway was the product of his mind. In his lost, I was changed to a new man. In my lost, he became known as a changed man. Across all the universe, across countless dimensions and realms that go beyond human comprehension, my quest to bring him back had led me to find more about myself. In that portal, I felt reborn, I felt broken, I stood on the shoulders of gods, and I saw where I really laid among the vast infinity.\n\nMaybe nothing has changed. But as that man once said, even in an isolated environment, nothing stays the same. I am not the man they think I am. I am not who I seem to be."

Capable and creative, there wasn't anything he couldn't do when he aplied enough effort and duct tape to it. For Stan Pines, he's without a doubt the best employee he ever had and Stan knows it.

Ready for some "Toss me a Dozen Eggs"?" asked the local market clerk.\n\n"Send them my way, Jimmy!"\n\nStan strolled through the fresh produce section of the grocery store as he caugh one egg after the other. With his quick sleight of hands, Stan didn't need to see through his cataracts to grab them. It came as natural as though he was pickpocketing the air itself.\n\nHumming himself a little tune, he rounded a corner to get to the corn, but was stopped by a small child with white hair nearly as tall as he was.\n\n"Hello there, Stanford Pines!"\n\n"Gideon!"\n\n"I see you wanted some corn? Well too bad!" He snapped his fingers and his father Bud rushed over and slid the entire display of corn into thier cart, "This corn is all mine!"\n\n"You little monster!"\n\nBud asked, "Uh, Gideon, what exactly do we need this corn for-"\n\n"Enough Questions!" He gestured to be picked up and placed in the cart seat, "Now drive old man!"\n\n\nBack at the Shack, Stan slammed his fist on the table in front of the console to the portal. As he grumbled about where to buy corn now, one of his many series of notebooks slipped off from the self and opened up. Stan took a look at it.\n\n"Huh? Glossaryck still owes be 50 Mewni Sols from the poker game last we- Wait a minute, Mewni! They have corn coming out of their ears! Haha!""

    stantastic.2.d:0 "From the deep depths Under the Mystery Shack, Stan emerged onto a land with a bright sun and an exotic sky. He paid no mind to the plants and astroids high above, the pink sky around him, or the castle in the distance. In front of him as a field of corn and a magical shield surrounding it. With him was an overly sized bad and a bundle of Dynamite he 'borrowed' from McGucket.\n\nRushing over to where a line of worker rats were using a hole in the shield to get corn.\n\n“Get! You filthy magic rats!”\n\nStan easily scared them off. He planted the Dynamite on the hole, lit the fuse and made a mad dash to the bushes at the outskirks of the woods near by. He took cover, only to notice two monsters next to him.\n\n"Hey, hows it going?"\n\n“Uhm... good, I guess?” replied Buff Frog.\n\nThe explosion went off, leave a trail of dust and a larger hole in the shield. Stan rushed back out anmd jumped in. Fatser than an army of rats, he swiped each and every cob of corn from thier stalks until his bag was twice his own size. Bag first, he shoved it out the hole and jumped out as well as it return to a msaller size. As he took out his small garage remote to reopen the portal, Stan could overhear someone yelling at him.\n\n"Stanford Pines! Come back with my Corn!""
    stantastic.2.a:0 ""Suck it, Rivers! It’s my corn now! Send my regards to the missus!""

    stantastic.14.d:0 "Stan pressed the button on his remote... and nothing happened. As he quickly kept pressing it, kights quickly converged on his location. Prepared for a fight, he dawned his bronze knuckles and quickly engaged them. Even in his old age, Stan dodged sword swings and thrust and deleivered a power punch at each knight he faced. The monsters in the bush watched in shock as Stan took them down and return to his stolen corn. But he turned away, one more warrior of Mewni arrived.\n\n“Well, well, well... well well, well, well, well. If it isn’t Stanford Pines!”\n\nHe turned back, shocked, "Mina! I thought you were roaming the multiverse?"\n\n"Oh I do some travel," Mina Loveberry said, smiling as she checked her nails, "But I pop in on my beloved Mewnie from time to time. And what luck do I have, to find you here? A Stump Day Miracle!"\n\n"Hehe, well," He pointed the remote at her, "Stay back Mina. You know very well what I’m capable of!"\n\n"Pfft, you’re a human. What can you do against Queen Solaria’s greatest warrior?!"\n\nAs they faced off, Rivers finished setting up a catapult on the balcony. He finished a bite from a corncob he had in his mouth and yelled out. "Stanford Pines! Get away from my Corn!" Rivers launched a burning boulder towards Stan. He cowered as Mina watched. But the flaming boulder was short in power and distanced and landed on the shield itself. It bounced off the magic shield, changing its trajectory. They both looked up as the boulder went back up into the air and landed right on top of Mina Loveberry, squashing her."\n\nRivers looked on in shock and slowly hid away, "Oops..."\n\nStan burst out laughing, "Oh, oh that. That’s just rich, hahaha." As Mina struggled to crawl from under the boulder on top of her, Stan walked over and placed a Mr. Mystery Bobblehead next to her. "Here you go, a gift from Earth’s Man of Mystery! And a bumper sticker for your, uh, rock here." Something on Mini’s person caught his eye. He reached over and grabbed her scissors. "Also, I’m going to borrow this. I don't need a chase now."\n\nStan slapped the sticker on the rock. He walked away and aimed his remote at the space in front of him. A portal opened up, and he quickly walked in to make his exit from Mewnie."

Beyond in the horizon were the southern mountains. Before them in the distance was the great Mewni River. And finally, beneth his view was the vast corn fields of the Butterfly Kingdom. It was as he looked down, he saw a strange figure lurking in the distance on the very edge of the magical shield protecting the corn. A man in a black suit and a red fez. Before River could take out his binoculars, there was an explosion! He turned to see who it was, now sure who they were as they carried a bag of corn.\n\n"Stanford Pines! Come back with my Corn!"\n\nStan Pines of the Mystery Shack yelled out, "Suck it, Rivers! It’s my corn now! Send my regards to the missus!"\n\nQuickly, he ordered his knights in to engage. Watching from above, he wasn't shock to see the multi-dimentional thief that allude capture for decades quickly take his knights out. River rushed back inside.\n\nA few minutes later, he came back out with a catapult loaded with a lit tar bar.\n\n"Stanford Pines! Get away from my Corn!"\n\nAs he launched it, he noticed that Mina Loverberry herself had cornered Stan. He then noticed the fireball. It fell short and counced off the shield. Then it squashed Mina instead!\n\n"Oops..."\n\nHe hid for a bit, still hearing Stan laughing at him and Mina. He turned to look, he was gone and so was the corn he stole."

    stantastic.5.d:0 "For the effort he went through, making a dump unicorn from mewni corn would be waste. Mewni corn is as yellow as its value in gold. Driving in the middle of the night to a shady part of Gravity Falls, he arrived at an abandon building. Slipping fake pointy ears on, he knocked on the door.\n\n"Go away" said the bouncer through the small sliding slit. Stan held up the corn to his eyes. "What is that?"\n\n"Corn... Mewni Corn."\n\nQuickly he was let in and he descended down into the Crawlspace, a hidden paranormal market underneath Gravity Falls. Whatever he needed here, he'll find it. And he had the perfect currency.\n\nThere was an assortment of different sellers and buyers roaming the market. He took note to keep his eyes from glancing at anyone the wrong way, as he could not afford any mishap. But he did get intrigued by some of the things he saw. There were witches selling hands and shady robed figures selling scrolls with people’s memories. One seller in a green trench coat had his wall filled with the faces of unsuspecting humans and creatures that were foolish enough to bargain with it. Every dark corner seemed to have a shady transaction going on, with a sun glassed gnome and a scared unicorn being the most notable. But as he walked through the crawlspace, he focused on who he was going to meet and what he wanted.\nBut there was one thing to catch his eyes and shift them towards it. Along the walls were an assortment of wanted posters. Some were new, overlapping others such as the head of a goblin like creature with a standing hair style, sharp rectangle glasses and the aurora of being a great host for interviews. Another was of an older woman with eyes that clawed at what it stared and imposing grey hair. The finally one was even older. A man with glasses, brown hair, and his hand held out. There were six fingers.\n\nHe arrived at a large stand he was familar with. Dismissal from the clerks turned to full attention when he held the corn up. Ushered into the main tent in the back, he met its owner, a cre4ature by the name of Mr. Kratin.\n\n"Ah yes. How good to see you again. I have the parts you need," he opened a secured briefcase holding special parts for the portal, "And I heard..."\n\nStan took out the corn, "You heard right. Corn stright from the Butterfly's personal corn field."\n\n"Marvelous! Lets... seal the deal, no?" \n\nAs they bargained, something caught his attention..."

She escaped, but left her precious staff behind."\n\n"I'll take it."\n\n"Its not for sale, I'm afriad."\n\nStan flicked his wrist, popping out a smoke bomb from under his sleeve, "Who said I'd pay for it?"\n\n He toss the smoke bomb and filled the tent in air. In the confusion, he grabbed the corn, the portal parts, and the staff before bursting out the tent and intot he open market. Mr. Kratin's guards rushed out and gave Stan chase. In the ensueing chaos, he smashed his way through other stands and others joined in on the chase after him. He turned to the staff.\n\n"Ah dang it. What was it... Owl? Hooty? No wait, not that tube... Albert? Owlbert? Owlbert!"\n\nNo response. He rounded a corner and hid in an alley as others continued on. Taking out his Journal 1, Stan tried to find something about the isles. It was then Mr. Kratin and his guards quickly founded him.\n\n"Stanford Pines! I should have known. Your disguice of a cheap carny may have decieve me, but no longer!"\n\nBack into a corner, Stan held the staff out, "Don't make me use this!"\n\n"If I couldn't use it, what could you possibly do?""

    stantastic.15.d:0 "Stan turned the staff upward and plunged it into the ground. A bright light flashed out, blinding them all. Kratin and the guards stumbled back as Stan held on to the staff and stayed at placed. What followed was a moment of silence. As Stan’s chasers struggled to get back up, Stan opened his eyes to see what happened. Above the staff head, the there was a small single point of light. It slowly began to move and made a small circle, a ring above the staff. When the ring completed, a small scroll appeared and dropped form thing air as the ring disappeared. It bounced off the staff and Stan attempted to catch it, juggling it around for a bit. Looking at the scroll, it popped out of his hand and into the air. It unrolled itself and began playing a video.\n\n"Hey there Kratin! How’s it going? I see you attempted to make use of my ‘staff’. Hate to break it to you there, buddy. But while I got what I wanted; you didn’t get squat! Since I am a good sport though, I hope you enjoy this toy staff replica of my own. Now with realistic Owlbert chirping!" The bird palisman on the staff lit up like a toy and played a poor-quality audio of an owl chirping, "From yours truly, Eda."\n\nThe scroll rolled up and fell and Stan quickly caught it.\n\n"Huh… I’m impressed! You know, I actually tau-“\n\n“Enough!” Kratin stood up, “Guards, destroy him!”\n\nAll round the crawlspace, a series of small explosions rang out. There was screaming as people panic and new voices over a megaphone shouted out orders and warnings.\n\n“This is the Forest Council Special Task Force! You are all under arrest for black market activities and failure to report said black market activities on your tax forms!” They could all hear a side conversation as someone corrected the gnome speaking, “Oh, sorry. You are all also under arrest for a series of other highly illegal crimes. You know, the sort of thing.”\n\n“It’s the cops!” yelled Kratin.\n\n“If that isn’t my cue, I don’t know what is."\n\nStan grabbed his stuff and ran off as chaos engulfed the market. Thinking of an escape route, he remebered Mina's scissors! Taking it out, he tour a dimension portal and jumped in, corn, parts, staff and all."

I was thinking a darker hue, but the architect argued otherwise.”\n\n“Uh, how’s things?”\n\n“Oh good, good. I certainly wish I could say the same about you though.” He pointed behind Stan.\n\nStan turned around.

Who did invite Rhombulus here? This was a private ambush- Wait! He’s distracting us!” Hekapoo took out her custom sheers, “Give back the scissors!”\n\n“Well, geez. You could have just asked,” Stan pulled out the scissors and tossed it to the ground between them, “I only took them because, well.

With releuctance, as he still holds massive sway with the commission, they agreed. The wait would not be long. Several hours later, they detected its usage, they rushed to the temple.

A though passed his mind just to stop and let it end right there. As he thought about submitting to fate, he turned and noticed the staff was glowing, radiating across its frame with true power.\n\n“*I haven’t seen that in... wait, that means!?*”\n\nThe Commission walked over to the edge of the pond. From out of the water, Stan came bursting out, the staff propelling him up and into the air. He landed back onto the ground in between the Commission and the knights.

Stan aimed for him and fired an energy blaststriking and launching him into the pond.\n\nMoon stood in place as the others charged in after him. Stan turned to them and began spinning his staff.

He ran back to the edge of the pond, kicked a struggling Rhombulus back into the pond, then turned back to Moon.\n\n“Well, it was nice, Moon,” He activated his remote and opened his portal behind him along the surface of the pond, “Hopefully, I won’t be seeing you around.”\n\nMoon rushed over, “Don’t you dare leave!”\n\nStan jumped backwards into the portal, “Haha, later Glossarych!”\n\nGlossarych waved goodbye, “Be seeing you, §RStanley§!.”"

I thought they ran out of corn yesterday?”\n\nHe sighed, “If I said it involved explosions, the black market and a police raid, would believe me than?”\n\nThe four of them all nodded, agreeing that sounded like something Stan would have gotten himself involved with in order to acquire something as mundane as corn.

When he got there, he was shocked to find a tiny owl carrying a sack full of stuff in his beak. The small owl looked back and was startled. He tried to run away from Stan, sack in tow, but Stan called out to it.\n“Wait! Owlbert!” he stopped and turned back, recognizing that voice calling his name. Stan walked over and kneeled down. He took off his fez to give Owlbert a better look at him and petted Owlbert. “Long time, no see, huh?” Owlbert chirped in happiness. Stan looked on towards the woods. He knew there were other ways from Owlbert’s world to travel here. Very far from home, but that never stopped her. “Look... uhm...” He reached into his coat and pulled out a bobblehead of himself. “Give this to her, would you?” He placed it down in front of Owlbert. The palisman took a moment to look at it before it grabbed it and placed it in the sack. Owlbert turned back to Stan and chirped in agreement. Stan stood up and watched as Owlbert dragged the sack into the wood and disappeared. He took a deep breath and sighed. As he walked back in, he pulled out the scroll the fake staff created last night in the Crawlspace. He unrolled it and played the video on it again.\n\n“From yours truly, Eda.”\n\nHe turned back to the woods where Owlbert went into..."

No, I rather not get squeezed to death by an overly-sensitive octopus'\n\nStan slurped his can of Pitt Cola and scratched himself as he stared at the coordinates screen of the portal. From memory, he inputted different dimension coordinates, giving the screen a look before dismissing it. Many worlds he has traveled to; Nearly that many worlds he has been banned from too. After spending half the night idly scrolling through his notebooks of dimensions, one crossed his mind.\n\n'C-137! Birdperson owes me money!' He got his coat on, but stopped and turned back, 'Forgot, Rick monsterfied that,' he toggled the dial to the other dimension he was now in, 'I hope this Birdperson also owes me money. And now to initialize the portal and-'\n\nThe portal abruptly turned off. The shutdown cascaded as the light in the control room went dark as well. Stan looked around in darkness, before a small side screen lit up in a dark red. Stan reached out and felt for his chair, then sat down to read the screen.\n\n'Energy Reactor: Empty'\n\nThe sight brought dread and annoyance. Stan had not had to refill the fuel source in years. He wasn't even using nuclear fuel. He was surprised it lasted as long as he did. But now he needed an Earth Base source. But where to get nuclear energy? The easiest would be nuclear waste, still rich in radioactive material. But the US transitioned to thorium after SDI was introduced. It won't be laying around in Oregon...\n\nStan sighed at the thought. He was going to need to make a short road trip out of state to get what he needed.'"

With a few days free to mosey on down and sneak past the Nevada State lines, he could go to the one place that would still have barrels of radioactive waste laying about. What's even better still is that the apparent collapse of the United States had made an opportunity to sneak in even better.\n\nAs far as he was concerned, it was going to be a very Homey place to be."

    stantastic_51.3.d:0 "Stan wasn't a stranger to Homey Air Force Base. He wasn't ignorant to the fact it was the infamous Area 51, a front for the Federal Paranormal Investigations. As he drove to his hiding spot to stage his break-in, he wasn't alone. Thousands of weirdos and nerds were all camped in the middle of the Nevadan desert. Blending into the crowd so close to the base, he learned they had gathered to launch a raid on Area 51.\n\n'Save the aliens, liberate E.T., uncover the truth, they can’t stop all of us!'\n\nStan couldn't help but laugh at their dumb plan. Aliens? Government secrets? Stan knew better. Area 51 was a backwater storage site for the FPI for decades now. It started with Roswell when an alien ship blew up a weather balloon as a sort of interstellar prank, only to crash their ship in some cosmic karma retribution. The FPI had to move all alien sites to random locations outside the country thanks to all the journalists thinking the base was where the aliens were. Stan had to admit, making everyone think Area 51 had the aliens instead of a base on a deserted island in the Pacific was genius.\n\nHe pondered. 'If only I brought some souvenirs to sell to these suckers.'\n\nBut he had a mission. And now two ways in. There was a secret passage along the ridge to the west he normally used to sneak through and the distraction of the nerds raiding the entrance would ensure no one was guarding it. But alternatively, the base is understaffed since the Kerfuffle and he could just join the raiders and follow right behind them as they overwhelm the base. Stan thought to himself, it would be more fun."

    stantastic_51.4.d:0 "After a short hike through Papoose Mountain, Stan slid down the ridge approaching the west end of Homey Airbase. As he approached the perimeter, he ducked behind some crates as Federal Air Force MPs and ran by. There were shouting, explosions, and a huge commotion on the other side of the base. As everyone turned their attention to the raiders, Stan quickly crossed the base and entered a door into the main hanger.\n\nAs red lights flashed and the air siren rang out outside, he reached the main office, abandoned in the distraction. File drawer by file drawer, he pulled out paperwork for anything about the waste. Quartermaster inventory, shipping manifestos, radiological reports. Nothing. This base wasn’t even serving as a storage depot anymore. An empty husk, no technology, no advanced exotic material, just a blip on the map to distract the populace. Anything useful was shipped out long before the kerfuffle, to other sites still useful on the continent. \n\nAs he sat down in exhaustion, he noticed two other reports. One, a material, Code Named- Sweat of Hercules. He read through it, realizing what the material really was. And he read the location. Fort Teller, Washington. Closer, but not any easier to approach as it housed the American SDI System. But even one drop can fuel his machine for another dozen years. The other report was a barrel of radioactive carbon retrieved from a STALKER for the FPI, still on-base after it had fallen off the truck near the gate when the last shipment left. He read the radiological samples. It was perfect. Not a lot of fuel, but enough for the meantime. At least he had a new site to scope out, and something to bring back home.\n\nTwo soldiers burst into the office. Stan stood up and raised his hands. He noticed their uniform and the armbands they wore. They weren’t Federal Soldiers, they were Californian, Imperial Soldiers. With no time to ponder how they are here, he slipped a smoke bomb from his coat and gassed the room. In the smoke, he fled and rushed to the main hangar wing. Looking at the second report, he got to the truck holding the barrel. Turning the engine on, he noticed a crate labeled ‘Corn Juice’. He shivered at the thought."

General Pines ducked out of the way as the truck veered out of the way and crashed through some empty crates. The soldiers formed up around the general and prepared to open fire, but Pines raised his hand to hold fire. He turned to his XO, a marine major. He nodded his head, and she nodded back. She began to run after the truck.\n\n‘Is that marine running after me?’ Stan looked back before turning eyes forward, ‘Shermie’s right about those crayon-eating-’ He looked at his rear view mirror. A bright light approached from behind at high speeds. He adjusted the mirror, focusing in on the source. A woman with two large wide moth wings, three arms on each side, approached him fast. He pondered, ‘Is that Moon?’ Finally, she got close enough, the details of her marine formal uniform being made out, as well as her six hands charging for a blast.\n\n‘By the authority of the Imperial California Republic, stop the vehicle immediately!’\n\n‘Huh, it’s Emily... Oh no, Mewberty Emily!’\n\nA strong magic blast struck just behind the truck. Stan veered to the right, making it pass the blown out fence and into the desert. She let out another roar and flung her arms at the truck, unleashing another magic blast. Stan slammed the brakes to dodge the shot, then banked left to regain distance from her. With his niece in hot pursuit, he scoped the grounds around him for an escape route. Dodging another blast that nearly threw the truck clear, he reached into the crate for a drink of the corn juice. \n\nInstead, he pulled out a vial filled with a yellow substance. Grossed out for a moment, he released what it was, seeing the substance give an ever mute glitter.\n\n‘Magic Water!’\n\nLooking back at the pursuing Emily Pines, he came up with a plan."

Eww, gross!\n\n‘This is as awkward for me as it is for you!’\n\nStan kept uncorking and coating her with the magic water, each splash driving her back a bit. The magic of the water from the realm of magic slowly began to take its effect. Stan emptied out the crate, tossing out the last vials of water at her. Down to his last vial, he needed to make it count. All the while, Emily refocused her effort and got even closer, now just mere feets away from grabbing him. Stan then pulled off his balaclava and revealed his face.\n\n‘Emily!’\n\n‘Uncle Stan?’\n\nDistracted, he threw the bottle right at her, smashing dead center on her face. Glass shards scattered about in the high speed pursuit and the magic water drenched her. Emily’s mewberty form rendering her impervious to the glass. But then, she stopped. Stan looked on. Her eyes were wide open, her pupils replaced with bright glittering stars. She smiled at her uncle, worrying the old man, then she flew straight upward into the air. Stan looked on as she opened up a dimensional tear and disappeared through it. He broke out in laughter, cheering for himself and his success.\n\n‘Haha! I’ll make it up to you for Christmas!’\n\nHe sat back down on the flatbed to rest. He stared at the barrel of radioactive carbon. Then something else struck him."

It was not the first time he had gotten himself ejected from a moving platform at high speeds. When he finally came to stop, he rolled over and stared up at the sky. Dark, peaceful. Nothing but rock, sand, and cactuses. He could make a bright light on the horizon. Sitting up, he realized it was Las Vegas in the distance.\n\nTaking a deep breath, he walked back to the truck. Seeing it stuck in the ditch outside Vegas, he began to ponder to himself. This wasn’t the first time he was here. His vehicle in a ditch after a lengthy car chase. Looking around, the land around him wasn’t too different as well. He looked up at the night sky once again. Squinting his aging eyes, he still made out that symbol he once knew so long ago, still being formed by the same stars, in both their worlds. Looking back at the truck, he laughed at himself.\n\n‘I guess I can’t blame you this time, huh?’\n\nHe took out that report he found and read it again. ‘The Sweat of Hercules’. Only someone strong, brave, and outright foolish like Hercules would try to get it once. Looking at the back of the truck and its single barrel of fuel, Stan realized he was even dumber than that greek prick. But if he wanted his brother back, he needed the Blood of the Titan. Under lock and key, maybe he needed to go to the source. He picked up a rock and tossed it at the truck, missing entirley."

    stantastic_51.8.d:0 "Stan gathered with the group as they marched on the entrance onto the base proper. He stayed back at the end, having no intent to stick out among the rest or get shot by the guards. As they approached the gate, it exploded. More explosions could be seens along the gate perimeter, the shockwave knocking them down. In the shouting and sirens came the rumbling of machinery behind them. Over the hills, tanks appeared and stormed down the bludd towards the base. On the leading tank was the flag of California flying ever heroically. Norton’s empire was striking the base, using the raiders as a distraction.\n\nThe raiders disperse as tanks and infantry charged through the fence and into the base. Stan hid behind some bush as it all happened. As he watched, he saw a humvee stop nearby. Stan ducked his head as two people got out.\n\n‘Status on our forces?’ he asked.\n\n‘Swiftly advancing across the base. Seems Guzman’s files were right. A backwater location, the lights kept on to keep appearances. Most of the base personnel have already surrendered,’ she handed him a tablet, ‘We already downloaded the base’s manifest.’\n\nStan whispered to himself, ‘Manifest?’\n\nStan snuck around, approaching them from behind. He pulled over his balaclava and pulled out his taser. Ever quietly, he tiptoed right up to them. At the last moment, his taser charged, the woman turned around with a roundhouse kick in mid air. Stan dropped to the desert ground and rolled to the side as she dropped her boot straight down where his face was. Stan jumped back up, pushed his back in and charged forward. She easily dodged, grabbed his arm, and pinned him. He looked at her, chuckling as a smoke bomb fell off his sleeve.\n\nSmoke engulfed them and Stan broke free and tasered her. The man pulled out his side arm and pointed it at the smoke. The only thing that came out was his daughter falling to the ground. As he approached, Stan whacked him behind the head. He grabbed the tablet and took a moment to take a look at the two of them.\n\n'Shermie, Emily?! Ah geez, this is... *sigh* The next family reunion is going to be weird.'\n\nHe took the tablet. Radioactive carbon! Yes! And a material code named Sweats of Hercules? He’ll read it later.

After loading the barrel into his car, he hightailed it out of there and back to Las Vegas.\n\n‘If only marching into heavily guarded government facilities were that easy!’\n\nHe snickered at the thought and reached for a can of Pitt. As he drove into city lines, he took a drink and stared up at a passing billboard.\n\n‘Give Lady Luck a spin on the Cash Wheel! Auditions today at the Northwest Tower!’\n\nStan smiled.

"Hey, you see this?"\n\n"Yup, I see it." Wendy still didn't look up.\n\n"Well... give me all the money in the register then!"\n\n"Hm... no."\n\n"...What?"\n\n"No. Nada. Nein."\n\n"Wha-!? I have a gun!"\n\n"Second Amendment's a thing, big whoop."\n\n"I- you know what? fine!" He picked up his gun and pointed it at her. "Get ready to kiss this world goodby-" With a DING of a frying pan, he fell down to the floor. Behind him was Dipper, who was holding said frying pan.\n\n"Uh... hi."\n\n"OH MY GOD, THANK YOU!" Wendy immediately got on her feet and jumped over the counter. She hugged him tight, picking him up and twirling around. "I thought I was a goner! He had a gun on me and everything!""

    mystery_shack_PR.2.d:0 "Lazy Susan has announced she will be vacating her seat on the council for the Service Industry. Nearing her retirement, this announcement wasn’t unexpected for some time. What was unexpected however was the exact timing, as there was not much in the way of an agreed successor to her seat. Quickly, the entire meeting between the Council and its members had devolved quickly into arguing and fighting over her seat as every business owner gave their month full of opinion.\n\nIn this chaos, it has become clear that two business owners in the service industry have emerged as the most likely candidate for the seat. The first is Stanford Pines, who runs the tourist popular Mystery Shack. The other is Buddy Gleeful, the owner of the Gleeful's Auto Sale and the legal owner of the local favorite Tent of Telepathy. Farmer Spur seems inclined to Gleeful, as Stan stole Spur’s cow. Preston oddly enough favors Pines, as Gleeful’s used car business interferes with his car industry.\n\nDuring the argument, Old Man McGucket approached Stan. Though he runs the Junkyard, Stan actually owns it after an agreement the two made decades ago. In a bout of sanity, he asked Stan to support having his son, Tate McGucket of the Lake Gravity Falls Pro Fish Shop, for the seat. A ridiculous idea, but Stan did think of it. Stan could barely muster support for the seat for himself and he would have little support from his own base on the council. But everyone likes Tate. Like the old McGucket, before he went insane, Stan knew he was a genius also. More importantly, Tate isn’t Bud, which alone is a good enough reason. Stan throwing support would ensure Tate gains the seat and a favor from both McGuckets could be worth far more than a seat. Especially since he had to pay monthly into the seat position if he won."

While Stan was no fan of the weirdo those weird Portlandiers picked, it was when Gideon reminded everyone who released trembley that suddenly the Shack gang was part of the conversation. People grew angry at him and the twins for unleashing the ‘Madman’ Trembley. The police claimed they interfered with the operation to stop Trembley. Some went so far as to call Dipper an communist and Mabel an anarchist.\n\nStan arose to defend his grandnephew and grandniece. He won’t stand for such McCarthy statements. At the very least, Dipper was an anarchist and Mabel was a Communist. ‘The Man should pay for dinner? We beat the soviets so I don’t have to, Mabel!’\n\nThe town awaits Stan’s response. He spoke..."

It gave me a mean eye, but Befufftlefumpter paid no mind and had his assistant wheel him over.\n\n"Mayor Befufftlefumpter."\n\n"Mr. Pines."\n\nHe had me sit on a couch.

I knew her, yet I did not.\n\n"A gift!" I nervously offered to him.\n\n He didn't seeme to care too much for it. A fancy vase I traded some souvineers for from a tourist a few years back. A better deal than that goat I would imagine. I paniked and insitintaully took out my wallet. I guess I was now just going to bribe him. As I did do, the card holder unfurled. Befufftlefumpter took a look, and quickly latched on to a picture I had of this year's staff. He demanded to see it. I handed it over and he stared at it with revernce. I swear he began to tear up.\n\n"She looks just like Annebelle..."\n\n"So, uh, about the hillside..."\n\n"What?

Stan was set on a good second first impression. Fresh fake safety permits were pinned all over the fair, everything on a stick was extra battered and fried, and the prices were slashed (after a hidden increase). Once again, he sat atop the dunk tank. A money maker the first time around, he sat comfortable knowing the target lever everyone was aiming for was as solid as the redwood trees around them. He doubted any of them had a 64th century energy weapon.\n\nAcross the fair, Soos, Wendy, and the twins were at "The Time Masheen", Stan's latest ride at the fair. Acquired from a man who "liked money", the four of them were setting up the ride. As they took their seats, Soos looked at the control panel.\n\n"Normal Mode. Kill Charlie Chaplin Mode... hmmm, what's the harm in doing the second one?"\n\nWhen he engaged the machine, the entire ride began shaking. Soos held onto the control panel as the carts began to suddenly accelerate away, Wendy and the twins still in them. They all screamed as the ride approached a bright flash."

Mabel and Waddles sat dazed as Wendy turned to Dipper, who was grasping on to her. When he realized that, he quickly let go and back off before nervously laughing it off.\n\nThey got off and walked out back onto the fair. As they looked around, all the rides and attractions were the same, but everyone was wearing different clothing: darker, sharper, punkier. One guy walled by, dressed in black with spiked shoulders.\n\n"Woah, is that a punked out Toby?" asked Wendy. She turned to look elsewhere.\n\nDipper picked up a newspaper from the trash can, "Presidential Candidate Ronald Regan criticized President Carter over letting Canada handle the Able Archer Crisis. BABBA begins their final tour around the world. New Tourist Attraction 'The Mystery Shack' begins their first ever Mystery Fair," he checked the date, "1984!"\n\nMabel sighed..."

You three shouldn’t be in this time period!” He made them grab hold of each other and he took out his time machine, the tape measure, to send them back to the present. As soon as they got back, he asked, “What was the device that brought you back to 1984?”\n\nSoos ran over to them, “Oh dudes, you’re alright! The Time Masheen went haywire and is still going! I thought the ride would have squashed you all to liquid... or something.”\n\nBlendin took a step forward, “Stand aside!” He took out an energy pistol and took aim at the Time Masheen. He fired a tiny energy bolt at the ride. A few quiet seconds later, the entire ride exploded ifa fierce blaze as sparks flew up in the sky. People around the fair stopped to stare at the bright lights and applauded at what they thought was a fireworks show. As the Time Masheen laid in a wreck, he turned back to them.\n\n“And don’t go around messing with the timeline. Y-y-you don’t want me coming back again!”\n\nBlendin took out his time machine and left. Soos turned to them, holding the charred remains of a T-Rex wearing an American M-1 Helmet."

I cut whole trees down with a single swing, and yet...”\n\nShe took a look, “How about I give it a try?”\n\nHe gave her a look, “You sure?”\n\nShe smiled, “I’m a Corduroy, aren't I?’\n\nAfter a moment, Dan nodded, “That you are, Wendy.”\n\n“Alright sis, dunk the Stan!” cheered her brother Marcus.\n\nStan chuckled as she got ready to throw, “Oh this is good. Let’s see if Daddy’s little girl can do better than Manly Dan!”\n\nShe groaned in annoyance, “Let’s make it interesting then. If I dunk you, Mr. Pines. I get the week off with pay. If I don’t, I’ll work free the rest of the summer!”\n\nStan laughed, “Oh, alright. I’m a betting man. Have at me, Wendy!”\n\nWendy got into the position. She raised her arm and took aim. Her eyes on the dunk lever, she veered off to the left instead. Her sights locked on. She left off her own fast ball. Flying fast threw the air, everyone saw as it approached Stan instead. Just off angled from Stan, the ball smashed through the glass container and broke the wooden bean holding Stan’s seat. Before he could realize what happened, Stan fell into the water, still able to hear the gargled cheers of the crowd that had gathered around the Corduroys.\n\n“The ol’ “Think outside the box”, or inside in this case,” she smiled and shrugged as the crowd cheered.\n\n“Haha, she has the Corduroy Arm!” Manly Dan exclaimed to everyone.
