 MYS_cheapest:0 "The cheapest money can buy!"
 MYS_cheapest_desc:0 "Though most would like to forget about it, many of the townsfolk had worked for Stan at the Mystery Shack at some point in its 30 years, from Edwin Durland to Annabelle Corduroy. But while Stan had burnt through more people than a wildfire through the forest, there was always one man Stan could count on. Even better, the man forgot that Stan promised him a raise."
 MYS_cheapest_effect:0 "<Looking through applications> That Valentino kid is too depressing for me. And I just don't like the look of Thompson... Wait, Annie had a kid?\n "

 MYS_the_pine_twins_desc:0 "I still remember that day, August 31st, all those years ago. Mable came first. Dipper second, nearly kicking the bucket as soon as he got it. I held them in my arms first before their granddad and got a fist clean across the face from my general of an older brother. Still, Shermie said they reminded him of when my twin and I were born. \nSaid it was ashame Stanley wasn't here."
 MYS_the_pine_twins_effect:0 "These two have each other, and they'll have their Grunkle Stan as well. That's all that matters."

 MYS_journal_3_desc:0 "Againts my own wishes, Mom and Dad insisted that me and Mabel spend the summer with out Great Uncle Stanford. Dad talked about all the time he and auntie Emily had fun in Gravity Falls. I wonder where's the fun in working at the shack and putting up signs in the woods..."

 MYS_stantastic_desc:0 "As the twins go about thier way, going on adventures, threading the line between life and death in the great outback of Gravity Falls, I'll continues on my work to repair the portal fully and bring this all to an end."

 MYS_stantastic_1:0 "Going on a grocery run"
 MYS_stantastic_1_desc:0 "It's the perfect attraction. A unicorn made of corn! And there's even a sale at the supermarket! I'll just head on down to town and grab some corn and glue. I better also make sure to store it away from the food black hole that Mabel calls a 'pet'."
 MYS_stantastic_1_effect:0 "Making a unicorn is easy. I've been attack by them so many times."
 
 MYS_stantastic_3:0 "From Mewni, With Corn"
 MYS_stantastic_3_desc:0 "'There are simple ways to get corn', is what my brother would say. But there are also fun and illegal ways to get corn and I think I'll go for that instead. Time to give the old land of magic and enchantment a visit."
 MYS_stantastic_3_effect:0 "What's a little corn between interdimesional friends?"
 
 MYS_stantastic_5:0 "To Take what was rightfully Stolen"
 MYS_stantastic_5_desc:0 "Mewni Corn would be an aweful waste on a tourist attraction. Its better off being sold in a shaddy location for ludicrous prices. And I know just the place in Gravity Falls to do that."
 MYS_stantastic_5_effect:0 "The regular black market was boring anyway. Not much demand for non-laser emitting pugs lately..."
 
 MYS_stantastic_2:0 "Running on Empty"
 MYS_stantastic_2_desc:0 "That gauge doesn't look right, I mean, I doubt it ever worked properly. I haven't refilled the portal's reactor since... well, since I was with her. A bit amazing how a few drops of that blue stuff lasted this long. Its not like I can ever get more of it, anyway."
 MYS_stantastic_2_effect:0 "I mean, the 'E' must mean that I still have like an extra 10 interdimesional miles left, right?"
 
 MYS_stantastic_4:0 "A Homey place to be in"
 MYS_stantastic_4_desc:0 "The open desert is a good place to hide stuff from the civilian populace. But its an even greater place to pretend to be hiding stuff there and make people think you are hiding stuff there! Let those idiots shout about freeing E.T.. As long as they got my fuel, I am good."

 MYS_stantastic_6:0 "What happens in Las Vegas"

 MYS_pr_path:0 "A relationship path has been choosen"
 MYS_false_flags:0 "The Con-Man won't be denied!"
 MYS_GF_shuffle:0 "Stan's Gravity Falls Shuffle has been performed!"
 MYS_PR_choice_effect:0 "§CWill be made avaible based on how you handle the Buisness Council and the Town Hall Forum§!"
 
 MYS_PR_1:0 "Stan and Gravity Falls"
 MYS_PR_1_desc:0 "Stanford Pines had lived in Gravity Falls for over 30 years. A visiting researcher turn permanent fixture of the town, one would presume Stan had made many contacts within the town. His Mystery Shack is a staple of the tourism in Roadkill County and many of its residents had grown up with the Shack as a fixture of their lives, from their own time spent there to the role it played in the local town economy."
 MYS_PR_1_effect:0 "Surely Stan would have become a staple of the town itself..."
 
 MYS_PR_2:0 "The Roadkill County Business Council"
 MYS_PR_2_desc:0 "The Roadkill County Business Council is a private group of the business owners in the county. Its leaders represent the different sectors of the economy: Lazy Susuan for the Service Industry, Farmer Sprott of the Primary Industry, and even Preston Northwest, personally representing the Manufacturing Industry in the county. That was actually expected as he owns all the factories in Roadkill County."
 MYS_PR_2_effect:0 "At this month’s meeting, an interesting development occurred. For Stan, if he plays his hand right, it would be an opportunity. Otherwise, disaster can easily loom."
 
 MYS_PR_3:0 "The Weekly Town Hall Forum"
 MYS_PR_3_desc:0 "A mandated event to inform the town of the ongoing events in the area, the weekly town meeting is often ignored by most of the residents. In any given meeting, it's either the mayor going on a delusional rant about how he was apparently the former leader of a secret government shadow agency, or a meeting for an actual shadow group, the Blind-Eye Society, whenever the meuseum is closed."
 MYS_PR_3_effect:0 "With the horror that is the Canadian Kerfuffle and the minor annoyance that is the collapse of the United States, some real action is needed by the town to handle the matter"

 MYS_PR_4:0 "Good PR"
 MYS_PR_4_desc:0 "For all the fault the town has, I know better then that their my only hope for the Shack and myself to stay afloat and survive. Having, as Mabel called it ‘Good Public Relationship’, is key to winning the town over. Besides, I'm the Man of Mystery! What isn’t there to love about the Mystery Shack and all the spooky, hazardous things inside!"
 MYS_PR_4_effect:0 "And Soos, fix those hazardous things inside the Shack. I ain’t in the hankering for a lawsuit."

 MYS_PR_6:0 "Free Souvenirs***"
 MYS_PR_6_desc:0 "Free Souvineers! Get your Free Souvineers!*** "
 MYS_PR_6_effect:0 "§R***Free "sourvineer" is at the management's disgression. Requires a $200 gift shop purchase and a purchase of a "Full Experience" Shack Tour on the same visit. Not libable for any physical or mental harm while on Shack premice and/or caused by said souvineer for the entirity of existance. Technically liable under EU law, but one must trick Man of Mystery to going to Europe for any litgation.§!"

 MYS_PR_8:0 "Community Service"
 MYS_PR_8_desc:0 "So the court has come to me with a plea deal of sorts. In my interactions with the town, I may have broke a few minor city ordiances. Stuff like robbing the Summer-Ween Store, burning down the Northwest Pinoneer Wagon on Pioneer Day, scared off the local pastor with my Devil's Costume..."
 MYS_PR_8_effect:0 "I swear, I thought the costume and the store thing were booked as the same crime!"
 
 MYS_PR_10:0 "The Mystery Fair"
 MYS_PR_10_desc:0 "The Mystery Fair! What no better way to bring the people of this town together. Playing games, almost winning prizes, partaking on rides and attractions with ‘special’ safety permits on them. Yup, this time, I spared ALMOST every expense. Not like I have a choice..."
 MYS_PR_10_effect:0 "Thanks to Dipper and Mabel’s shenanigans with some bald guy that sounded like a Morty, the entire day got wiped from history. And my profits along with it! Just a corn eating pig to show for it..." 
 
 #####################
 MYS_PR_5:0 "Back Taxes"
 MYS_PR_5_desc:0 "Building leeway into the workings of the town government requires not compromices, but offerings of appeasment. I haven't really made any friends with the mayor or the council. But maybe being on the by and by can help. And we all like money after all... unfortunatley."
 MYS_PR_5_effect:0 "Surely we can write off some of these items, right?"

 MYS_PR_7:0 "Council Lobbying"
 MYS_PR_7_desc:0 "The Town Council has never been interested in my dealings. Unlike the old chook above them and the crazied constituents that voted for them, these are ordinary people that happen to live this this crazy place. Honestly, that makes them the biggest weirdos in Gravity Falls."
 MYS_PR_7_effect:0 "But we all talk in the same language... sorta?"

 MYS_PR_9:0 "A Gift for the Mayor"
 MYS_PR_9_desc:0 "I thought it would take longer, but Mayor Befufftlefumpter- Hey, I said that right! The old chook wanted to have a sit down with me. This is my chance! The town took some land of "mine" a few years back over the whole 'Jembles' incident. Maybe I can win him over with a gift?"
 MYS_PR_9_effect:0 "Just don't mention World War 1, just don't mention World War 1!"

 MYS_PR_16:0 "Our Man Stan!"
 MYS_PR_16_desc:0 "I didn't think it would ever happen, with my past, and the plans I had for my future, I doubted that this town would ever like me. But here I am. Their Man, Stan! My pollings even put me ahead of that smug little Gideon! Beisdies ithe increace tourism, I wonder if I could use this popularity in the future?"
 MYS_PR_16_effect:0 "I mean, what other uses does having the love of the town give besides making money, anyway?"

 MYS_PR_12:0 "'Job Makers'"
 MYS_PR_12_desc:0 "The local economy has been in a slump since the Canadian Kerfuffle and the collapse of the US. But oddly enough, the tourism industry is prospering! Must have something to do with people getting their minds of the potential war between Oregon, Washington, and California.\nNow, people are in need of jobs. And I could use some cheap lab- I mean, new valauble employees!"
 MYS_PR_12_effect:0 "Got to work for that minimum wage!"

 MYS_PR_13:0 "Supporting 'Small' Business"
 MYS_PR_13_desc:0 "What is investing but a smarter looking way of gambling? What kind of man would I be if the I didn't rig the game? With the recent economic downturn, the businesses in town could use some inflow of cash.\n\nSure, Preston Northwest can offer more. But would you trust a rich snob, or your local nighborhood Mystery Man?"
 MYS_PR_13_effect:0 "And remember, meet the minimum payment, or Wendy will have a very unpleasent chat with you."

 MYS_PR_14:0 "Gravity Falls Shuffle"
 MYS_PR_14_desc:0 "The local hills beyond the shack use to be part of my property. But due to some completely misunderstood incident involving the mayor's galapagos turtle, the town confincastwed my land. Naturally, everyone would assume I take it back."
 MYS_PR_14_effect:0 "But honestley, I could use something with some water front property..."

 MYS_PR_15:0 "And this Con-Man You can't Change"
 MYS_PR_15_desc:0 "Someone once told me I can't change. Honestly, maybe she was right. The fact I am here and not there proves that. But I won't go down. I survived up to now and I'll keep on survivinging. I have a mission and I won't stop.\n\nThis Con-Man they can't Change!"
