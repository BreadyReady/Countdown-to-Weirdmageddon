 ORE_economy_event.1.d:0 "Struck out and on our own, Oregon turned to the heart to rebuild. The great Willamette River gave us a grand and fertile valley that embodied the old West and for which our state and the true America shall rise once again heading back East. From increased agriculture and manufacturing, our new investments into the valley have quickly transformed the great river into a new technological mecca for which the latest advancements are now under development.\n\nAs the newest Doogle, Mewtube, and QMD campuses are opened outside of Portland, Willamette River has become the Silicon River, rivaling the old tech hubs across the fallen US in California, Texas, and the Koreas. President Trembley gave a speech at the new campus, quipping about what possibilities and new "Magic from the Atom" we can achieve."

 ORE_economy_event.2.d:0 "Struck out and on our own, Oregon turned to the grand lands of Cascadia for the answer. Our ancestors traveled the great trail that bears our state’s name to this land of new beginnings and opportunity. Her forests are grand and stretch wide and are bound with life. Her rocky mountains reach for the sky and are full of vital raw resources.\n\nWith our investment, we have strengthened our state from the Pacific Coast to the Snake River. From the fall of the US, new wealth is made like the old Gold Rushes and the lives of rural Oregonians have improved when once ignored. The people flock to Trembley for their thanks, and some even go to the governor they once didn’t like for bringing Trembley and the idea of a True America to them. Many challenges await, but her speech when campaigning in Gravity Falls says it best."

 ORE_NORTHWEST_EVENT.1.t:0 "Northwest Capital"
 ORE_NORTHWEST_EVENT.1.d:0 ""And the numbers?" asked Milly Onyx.\n\n"Not well," the secretary of the treasury said, "We’re running low on capital and our revenue has dropped drastically with international trade gone."\n\n"But our renewed interstate commerce?"\n\n"Nowhere near enough to replace it. Losing California was costly, and we’re squeezing our belts tighter now that Medford is under FPI hands."\n\nMilly pondered what to do as Secretary Chiu and Colonel Northwest walked in. She turned to them, "We have a problem. We need revenue and loans, ASAP. We can’t stand againts Washington, the Feds, or the Califonrians in our condition."\n\n"I’m aware, Madam Vice President. The colonel is here to talk to you more about that."\n\n"Really?" she turned to him, "What do you have?"\n\n"Not me, ma’am. My brother. Preston Northwest has been made aware of the government’s financial situation. It took some persuading, but he has agreed to a meeting to discuss loans and other ecnomic aid."\n\nThe secretary of the Treasury quickly turned to Milly, "Ma’am, I highly suggest we look into it. The northwest still have access to their vast fortune around the world and funneling the money can help prop up the economy and spur more growth."\n\nMilly nodded, already knowing that Preston Northwest wanted something from Oregon."

 ORE_NORTHWEST_EVENT.2.t:0 "Paying off old sins"
 ORE_NORTHWEST_EVENT.2.d:0 "As a show of power, Parson was late. As Trembley and staff awaited at a disclosed location in Bends, the Northwest private helicopter finally arrived and touched down. Preston was less than enthusiastic that it was his brother Parson that was there to greet him, but he kept his displeasure mostly hidden as Andrew Chiu was there and Preston was well aware of who he was and what he was capable of.\n\nIn the meeting room, President Trembley greeted him and they began to talk.\n\nAn assistance gave Trembley a presidential binder holding what Oregon wanted and Trembley presented that to Preston. Parson gave it a quick look.\n\n"These are your terms? You can’t be serious."\n\n"I am, Mr. Northwest. And don't call me shirley."\n\n"Still, this is a massive loan you are asking from a simple private citizen. And your rates and terms are not very conducive to enticing a willing loaner."\n\nTrembley sat back in his seat opposite of Preston, "Maybe so. But for me, working for someone whos fortune was made erasing me from history can be... difficult."\n\nPreston chuckled, "Now the sins of my ancestors can’t be pinned on me. I’m innicoent."\n\n"Of course you are," Trembley affirmed, "But of course you can understand that we can’t let ill gotten gains be allowed to flow freely. I might have to exercise the asset forfeiture-"\n\n"Be careful what you say, Mr. president."\n\n"and be careful what you do, Mr. Northwest. If I go for your wealth by force, every subsidiary in the country will be open to seizer. And if they’re not safe, some of those CEOs might just spin their subsidiary as their own company!"\n\nThat put Preston back in his seat. In another room watching the meeting, Andrew and Parson commented on Trembley’s negotiations skills."\n\n"Trembley really is a politician at heart. And a scary one," said Parson."
 ORE_NORTHWEST_EVENT.2.a:0 ""He did get five babies on the court. Hell, one of them is still alive!""
 
 ORE_NORTHWEST_EVENT.3.t:0 "Art of the Deal"
 ORE_NORTHWEST_EVENT.3.d:0 "After the sitdown with Preston Northwest, a deal was struck over the conditions to give the loans to the Trembley Federal Government. Northwest of Oregon, the direct subsidiary to the whole company, is prepared to give tens of billions in both loans and aid. In return, President Trembley must publicly pardon Nathanial Northwest, the ancestor who was used as pawn to cover up Trembley’s erasure from history.\n\nAs Trembley contemplated this deal, officials from both sides argued. If they accept, the aid would, for the moment, place Oregon in a footing with California, which would greatly counter their influence. Some of that money, through the magic that is whatever international banking system is still working, would even come from Northwest of California, which is helping bankroll Emperor Norton. But if we accept the deal, any chance for justice for Trembley through the Northwest would be gone and the Northwest Family, mainly Preston’s immediate family would be untouchable moving forward.\n\nt\Trembley stood up and silenced his cabinet with his answer."
 ORE_NORTHWEST_EVENT.3.a:0 ""We Accept!""
 ORE_NORTHWEST_EVENT.3.b:0 ""No Deal! Begin seizures immediately!""

 ORE_NORTHWEST_EVENT.4.t:0 "North by Northwest"
 ORE_NORTHWEST_EVENT.4.d:0 ""And though our paths crossed through shadowy events, I am glad to say we and the Northwest can leave the past behind and step forward into the future!"\n\nTrembley gave his public speech to a news conference as he announced the official pardon of Nathanial Northwest. He and Preston Northwest answered questions of the situation and Trembley was able to deflect most criticism of the Northwest Family at the FPI's expense, an easy target as they were just South of the Umpqua River.\n\nAlready, the influx of cash has revitalized the economy and the effects were working they're away down and back East to the Trembley align states. Northwest of California even had to announced scale backs on major government projects as their cash reserved was taken by the parent company.\n\nStill, many were not happy and wanted blood from the Northwest. One report found out how to get it by asking of the relationship between Preston and Parson Northwest, before subitally singing praise of the Commander of the Army, and veiled criticism of the younger brother. Preston faked an excuse to leave the newspress early, but the populations was still riled up at the news of no justice for the President.\n\nAs for Trembley, for all the craziness in his head, his care was in the people first before his own pride."

 ORE_true_ninth_event.1.t:0 "The True Ninth"
 ORE_true_ninth_event.1.d:0 "President Trembley’s return has required a major rewrite of our history books.\n\nFrom what FPI records we got, we found out that he was the true ninth president of the United States. He won his election in 1837 in a landslide, literally, when a landslide killed all his opponents in a debate, though records indicate he likely was going to win regardless. The reason for an election was due to a constitutional crisis when Van Buren died early into his term. When Trembley’s Vice President, John Tyler, successfully ousted him without a proper impeachment, he created the false ninth president William Henry Harrison to cover for both Van Buren’s death and Trembley’s removal, and claimed the tenth presidency for himself, He ordered the FPI, which Trembley ironically elevated into a full government agency during his short term, to track him and erase him at the right time.\n\nSince then, he traveled the country for a few decades, popping up from time to time. He founded the town of Gravity Fall and helped turn Oregon into a state. At one point, he even went to San Francisco, where he was knighted by Emperor Norton and given the title of "Lord Protector of Oregon".\n\nIt was after he soon disappeared in the late 60s that the FPI, coming off its first interdimensional victory on Mewni, enacted the Northwest Coverup to remove him from history.\n\nNow though, we will make sure Trembley is known by all Americans and he takes his place from the Eight and a Half to the True Ninth!"
 ORE_true_ninth_event.1.a:0 "Hail to the True Ninth!"
 
 ORE_true_ninth_event.2.t:0 "A Proper Madman"
 ORE_true_ninth_event.2.d:0 "From the outside, it seemed the new Federal Government was actively busy, working away to get things done. Internally, everyone from lowly clerks to staff interns to elected officials were running about in a chaotic panic like headless chickens. Many of Trembley’s reforms have turned the traditional American government upside down and people were either rushing about to get new procedures up and running or just running in a circle from all the disorder that was now at play. The VP was attending a news conference and shunned any request for help from the other officials while state Secretary Chiu was using magic to implement reforms, with minor success.\n\nBut with high approval and many new officials ready to use the new chaos to forged their own legacy in government, trembley’s government was as vibrant as any system in America gets."
 ORE_true_ninth_event.2.a:0 "A Government at work shouldn't be a weird sight to behold."
 
 ORE_true_ninth_event.3.t:0 "A True Politician"
 ORE_true_ninth_event.3.d:0 "For all the erraticy of Trembley, he is unusually in sync when it comes to politicking. While many view the politicians of the rural northwest as subservient to the power brokers of the two branches of the New Democratic-Republicans, they are in fact very outspoken and influential people in their own right, from the liberals and progressives of the cities of Willamette valley to the conservatives and libertarians of the rural cascadia.\n\nTrembley, even two centuries apart knows how to speak to these people and has proven to be a shrewd negotiator. Unlike the political division of California where ‘Emperor" Norton is relying on sheer presence to hold things together, Trembley has maintained the unity of the Oregon NDRs and used them in masterful strokes to pass legislation and rally public support for them. It can be difficult for any man to do anywhere near what he has done. While President Curtis has divided this nation, both people and politicians can see Trembey can unite this nation and restore america back to prominence."
 ORE_true_ninth_event.3.a:0 "The People and the Party stand by President Trembley"
 
 ORE_true_ninth_event.4.t:0 "Crazily Calm"
 ORE_true_ninth_event.4.d:0 "In recent days, there has been a calm in President Trembley. Once there were almost maddening ideas of insane reforms and erratic legistartion, Trembley has been more soft spoken and yielding to his Vice President and State Secretary on more moderate, political and in tone, ideas.\n\nIn recent speeches, this tone was more calm and reserved and people are starting to notice this new man. Almost groomed into a traditional politician, some say this new trembley gives a feel of noralicy. But many are equally bewildered by it and are suspicious of the fact. The division it's causing now is unlikely to be critical, but is still very noticeable. As for the NDR party, keeping things normalized seems unpopular now, but maintaining the status quo will only help us in the long run."
 ORE_true_ninth_event.4.a:0 "The Normalcy, The Calm... its eerie!"
 
 ORE_true_ninth_event.5.t:0 "The 46th President"
 ORE_true_ninth_event.5.d:0 "As we claim to be the true, legitimate continuation of the American Government, it is important we keep to as much of the original rules and procedures as laid out in the Constitution. Of course, the Constitution can be amended. Today, as our new congress announced the de-legitimacy of President Curtis back east, the congressed as amended a "Continuation of Government" procedure to the 25th Amendment to give a former President a succession path during an emergency.\n\nWith it, President Trembley was inaugurated once again as our president, and the massive turnout in Salem show we have little worry of any election need. The True Ninth before, Quentin Trembley is now the 46th President of the United States of America. Soon, he will that in more than name!"
 ORE_true_ninth_event.5.a:0 "Hail to the President! Hail to the Chief!"
 
 ORE_true_ninth_event.6.t:0 "Senate Committee"
 ORE_true_ninth_event.6.d:0 "President Trembley has come before the Senate to push for his new appointee for a cabinet position. Naturally there was discussion and debate about who he selected, more so than usual.\n\nFor the vacant Secretary of Defense, he had brought forth two possible nominees, a Great White Shark named Fluffy, and a Blue Whale named Skitty Jr. Oddly enough, most of the senate were legitimately debating their qualifications, only a few were bewildered that two sea creatures were being nominated for government positions. One in particular debated if they should be the Navy Secretary instead, before being called a racist.\n\nThe Senate needs to make a decision. It's almost lunch time and the taco truck outside the building in Salam gets crowded at this time."
 ORE_true_ninth_event.6.a:0 "Aggressive as the Shark!"
 ORE_true_ninth_event.6.b:0 "Slow, Steady and Ensured as the Whale"

 ORE_wicked_chiu_event.1.t:0 "The Gravesfield Project"
 ORE_wicked_chiu_event.1.d:0 "As Andrew Chiu and Parson Northwest discussed the local mapping around the newly constructed training base they were at, a dimensional portal opened up. Unlike most portals, mainly magical ones, that had a relatively clean tear through reality, this one was more jagged and had small electrical arcs jumping from it. The signature of a human based portal machine. Parson turned to it, pistol at the ready but Andrew lowered his arms. From the portal came a team of FPI agents, with an assortment of equipment.\n\n"That was quite an entrance, Raj."\n\nThe agent chuckled, "Traveling cross-country is a bit harder these days, Andrew. Fortunately for you, I’m friends with Deputy Director David at the EIO. What I would give to see how their intra-dimensional portal works."\n\n"We can worry about portal tech another time. The equipment?"\n\n"Ten Mark VIII Arti-Sacks and new manufacturing equipment." He pointed to the new equipment and the backpack-like gear being unloaded, "Five extra, courtesy of the EIO and what they took from MI-13 after the split."\n\n"Honestly can’t believe Amy approved the release of any of this gear. Could use the old team again."\n\n"You’re in luck. She didn’t. Just about everyone loyal to you is now in Oregon, either with Shroud," he gestured to his own team, "Or here with you."\n\n"That would mean-"\n\n"We’re too old to fight, Andrew. But we can teach. Give us a team... and we’ll have you a new coven of witches in no time."\n\nAndrew smiled."
 ORE_wicked_chiu_event.1.a:0 ""The President’s Coven has a nice ring to it, hey Raj?""
 
 ORE_wicked_chiu_event.2.t:0 "Boot Camp"
 ORE_wicked_chiu_event.2.d:0 ""These are the best we could find?" asked Andrew.\n\n"Many are hesitant. Fight for a President from the 19th Century, sure. Become a witch and do witchcraft? Apparently a push too far. But I do have a list of officers and enlisted men still interested, if this first batch works out," said Parson.\n\n"So be it..." Andrew, Parson, and the new magic ranger instructors arrived at the training ground where nine volunteers were awaiting them. With Parson as the ‘Head Coven Witch’ for all of them, only two others were Parson’s men. The rest were an odd assortment of civilian volunteers that somehow got pulled into the project. One was a middle aged musician who brought their electric guitar with him, another was clearly a farmer from the straw hat, dirty blue jean onesies and a "I love Brighton" shirt. Mixed with the team was a technical looking person in business casual and a fleece vest more at home in an tech company and oddest of all was Governor Milly’s daughter, who was texting away on her phone.\n\n"Should I remind you of California's program-"\n\n"I am well aware of what they are doing. Especially since Hector isn’t even trying to help them" Andrew turned to the volunteers, "Good Morning recruits! First off, President Trembley thanks you being the first volunteer-’\n\n"Hey, so this is the course to learn magic, right?" asked someone.\n\n "Magic, I was told they needed some agriculture expert?"\n\n"Same for me, but tech. My last job ‘volunteered’ me with a pink slip!"\n\n "I thought we were gonna jam. Harsh vibes I’m getting from this."\n\n "I can’t believe mom made me waste my summer doing this."\n\nRaj turned to Andrew, "Well... this is better than that first batch 50 years ago."\n\n"Still..." Andrew held his hand up and drew a wide circle above their heads. A ring formed from it and then glowed bright as a blast of energy was shot up into the sky, grabbing all of their attentions.\n\nAndrew sighed."
 ORE_wicked_chiu_event.2.a:0 ""Witches are easy to train. Humans are not.""
 
 ORE_wicked_chiu_event.3.t:0 "Coven Armament"
 ORE_wicked_chiu_event.3.d:0 ""And this is your main equipment, from which we humans will be able to perform this unique variant of magic." Andrew held up a special mechanical device that was to be strapped onto a person’s back like a backpack as they took notes in the classroom they were in, "This is a Wittebane Mark IX Artificial Vilesack Injection Portable Exo-Skelton System, or AVIPE. Name first, acronym later. This variant is a modernized variant used by the FPI during Operation Hercules and adapted for mass production in Oregon. Learning to use this will be critical to being able to both perform magic and regulating the strength of your magic. Any questions?"\n\n"Uh yes, how does it work? Does it just give us powers from just wearing it?" Asked the musician Wolfgang.\n\n"Oh heavens, no." Raj took the Arti-sack and showed the spinal interface, "These needles will subtly inject a special magical serum similar to what native witches have inside their vile sacks and use it to control and summon magical powers... Its not as painful as it sounds."\n\nEveryone in the room talked with one another, still doubtful of the use of this system, let alone the entire prospect of undergoing this process to give Oregon magic users. Milly’s daughter, Jennifer, casually raised her hand and spoke, "How come you and these men in black guys don’t use them and can still do magic."\n\n"That’s classified," said Raj.\n\n"Hold on there," he starred down Jennefer, who kept a bored expression as Andrew talked, "Simple, Ms. Onyx. We have actual vile sacks. We infiltrated the government of the world this magic came from, hunted down the strongest witches we could find, brought them back to Earth alive, dissected them and inplanted their vile sack into us to give us full magical abilities. Is that satisfactory?"\n\nShe raised an eyebrow, "You kidnapped witches, killed and harvested their organs, and input them into your own body..." She perked up for once, "Can I do that?"\n\nAndrew moaned, dropping his head in exhaustion, "No, Ms. Onyx, we will not be harvesting organs and impanting them into you. And your mother will kill me if we did that."\n\nShe rolled here eyes in disappointment."
 ORE_wicked_chiu_event.3.a:0 ""Fine, give me the stupid exo-skelton.""
 
 ORE_wicked_chiu_event.4.t:0 "Cross Pollination"
 ORE_wicked_chiu_event.4.d:0 ""Do-Re-Mi-Fa-So-La-Ti-Do!" whispered Wolfgang to a withered flower in the greenhouse on base. As he turned to another plant, he noticed as the flower he sang to returned to life and blossomed, even as the morning light had yet to hit the garden, "Talia, Talia!"\n\n"What?" she said as she was practicing a levation spell, holding up a few pitchers of water to water the plants.\n\n "This flower! Like it was dead, but I sang to it. And now it alive and in full bloom."\n\nTalia chuckled, "Plants love being sung to."\n\nWolfgang looked at her, mildly annoyed, "As Head ‘Witch’ of the Harmonics Coven Corps and you being the leader of the Agriculture Coven Corps, we both know that. But I'm testing the suit right now to see if singing also can be used to project magic powers. Come over here. And watch me do it again on this rose bush."\n\nThey both head to a potted bush and he adjusted his exoskeleton to increase the power yield. Clearing his voice, he began to sing and made up the lyrics on the spot, "Roses, bright roses. Come alive before me. Beat the sun before it raises, blossom and be free..." And on the spot, a light magic aurora surrounded the bush brough each young bud to full maturity and blossomed in full bloom.\n\n"Woah! This is that mixed magic method Secretary Chiu told us. This is amazing, I can’t believe they banned such a thing where the magic comes from. Let me try it. My niece Libby says I have a lovely voice."\n\nThey walked over to another budding potted plant and she activated her artificial vile sack. She began to sing, but was massively off pitch from the start. As Wolfgang cringed at the singing, he noticed that all the plants in the greenhouse were shaking and reacting more and more violently as she sang. There was then an explosion as pieces of the greenhouse went up into the air and rained on the base. As emergency teams rushed to the greenhouse, a battered Wolfgang and Tali stood in the burnt mess that was once a green garden. He turned to her.""

 ORE_wicked_chiu_event.5.t:0 "The Majestic Northwest"
 ORE_wicked_chiu_event.5.d:0 ""Just remember your training, Colonel. It's just three versus one," said Andrew from the sideline as Parson prepared for a sparring session between him and Agriculture Head Witch Talia, the Abomination Head Witch Joseph, and the Illusions Head Witch Jennifer.\n\n"Outnumbered, I can do. Fighting with magic for the first time, that’s a bit tricky." Parson remarked.\n\nAndrew chuckled, "It's nothing for the head of the President’s Coven Corps, right Bujeog?"\n\nHis palisman cockatoo on the tip of his staff came to life and spoke, "Squawk! Kill, Slaughter, Destroy! Squawk!"\n\n"Dumb taking magical bird..."\n\nThey began. Jennifer rushed at him first, quickly conjuring up illusionary mirror images of herself to cover her advance. Talia coordinated with her assault, raising up a thick vineage wall to force Parson to move forward. Joseph, flanked by two of his abomination creatures on either side at the back fo the trainng area, sent some armored abominations to follow up Jennefer’s diversionary attack as he held onto a tablet to analyze their performance.\n\nParson acted quickly, summoning up the earth around him to form a shell as the Jennifers threw themselves at him. Behind most of the Jennifers, a giant plant bud sprouted out from the ground and Parson jumped out. While the Jennifers tried to turn back, Parson threw up some energy blasts to knock out the abominations coming at him. Talia tried to counter by unleashing a horde of stabbing vines as Jospehe conjured up another squad of the purple slime beast and the Jennifers were about to strike from behind.\n\nIt was then Parson took advantage of their attack, first wresting control of the vines from Talia and striking them into the ground. A bed of plants popped out across the sparing ground and with a flick, they pumped out a haze of pollen, which stopped and quickly dissipated the sneezing Jennifers to only the real one, who Parons promptly blasted away out of bound. Talia tried to counter, as Parosn quickly began to scorched-earth what he created and unleashed a fire storm at her. She flinched as she was hit, noticing she wasn’t being burnt. Realzing the illusion, that was when a block of ice formed under her and she was tossed her up and out of the sparring ground. Joseph tried to bring up more abominations as he made more notes, but they were quickly cut down as his personal two abominations were either consumed by a giant man eating plant or tossed up into the air by a sudden column of rising earth. As Parson walked up to him, he promptly surrendered.\n\nAndrew applauded as Parson walked off in exhaustion and the others picked themselves back up to visit the medbay to give the Medical Coven some practice."

 ORE_wicked_chiu_event.6.d:0 "President Trembley and Vice President Onyx sat in their booth with the crowd as the Oregon Magic Ranger Corps was unveiled to the general public. The Coven Corps Leaders stood with their new recruits as each displayed a different aspect of their magic, from the Husbandry Corps summoning wild and furious animals from the Cascadia Wilderness to parade in total discipline, to CBRN Corps creative use of potions to replicate multiple forms of magic performed by the others, ending with their fireworks display, though magic wasn’t really need for that. As Parson gave a speech of the magnetic magical force of cascadia and how it will defend them from the ‘poor’ replication of Mewman magic by California, Andrew was at the stands with his family, watching the event. His granddaughter Candy was mesmerized by the display of magic. Andrew stepped away as Agent Raj and his team continued to monitor the event. Both turning to the crowd and the members of the Coven Corps of Oregon, Raj spoke.\n\n"Do you ever think about what might be going on back there?"\n\n"Nope," Andrew replied quickly.\n\n"I wonder why I don’t believe you."\n\n"Because the truth hurts... besides, why even think about the Boiling Isles?\n\n"Because Philip is still there!" Raj sighed as he saw a spectacle of the Illusionary Corps, making the evening night appear as though it was full day, "We knew what he was doing. And he was able to stop us. One man against the full might of the two most powerful organizations on Earth."\n\n"And your point Raj?" Andrew snapped, "We failed. He played us all off each other and it's a miracle we survived! Besides, there’s no way we could ever return. Our fate... and theirs, are sealed."\n\nRaj scuffed at his words, "How easy it is for you to say, Andrew. Humanity will make it through the Long Summer. For all I know, I’m one of the last witches in this realm or the next!"\n\nHe quietly stormed off as Andrew turned back. He sighed and walked back to his seat. As his son took pictures, Candy asked him, "Hey harabeoji. Do you think I can be a witch one day like them?"\n\nHe chuckled, "How did you even get that idea?"\n\nShe pointed to the family bird Bujeog, who said, "Squawk! She can be a powerful witch! Squawk!"\n\nAndrew shooed his palisman away. For all he had brought to the public of his past, most still know nothing of his former life. Andrew smiled."
