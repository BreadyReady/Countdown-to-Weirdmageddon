 UFC_START_EVENT.1.t:0 "The Roars of the Forest"
 UFC_START_EVENT.1.d:0 "Up in the mountains of Northeast Oregon was a series of deep and interacted caves. Far from the eyes of the gnomes and taunts of the manotaurs was the home of the Multi-Bears, ferocious yet calm beast with multiple heads and an intelligence to match. Often found in slumber and hibernation, these creatures of the forest of Gravity Falls once had little care of the day-to-day activities at the base of their mountain, where the rule of Gnome Queen reign supreme and kept order. In their their caves they have their solitude and 80s music.\n\nNow though, that time of peace had come to an end. The Death of the Gnome Queen has thrown the Forest into disarray. With the Gnomes in retreat, and the Manotaurs and Unicorns taking control of their local area, so has the time come that the Multi-bears emerged from their caves and spread out to bring order to land. There were little the disorganized denizens of the forest could do against these multiheaded bears.\n\nBut between the brutish Manotaurs and the ever-manipulative Unicorns, the Multi-Bears and their intellect and poise could very well be the key to a new future in the Forest. As the Long Summer begins and Gravity Falls turn a Blind Eye to what rumbles in the woods, a fight has broken out. The Manotaurs have crossed the river Trembley, and the Bears stand ready to drive them back. Even in the deepest part of the Forest, any rumble will soon be heard by all."

 UFC_MANWAR.1.t:0 "A Final Plea For Help"
 UFC_MANWAR.1.d:0 "Two FPI agents stood by the post at the road leading up to the mayoral mansion. Part of the special division assigned to the former director as part of the agreement for him to step down, they watched from a computer in their guard booth as the different elements of the FPI were splintered across the country, thankful they were not part of that mess of a kerfuffle. It was then they heard a commotion in the treeline. The agents took position and aimed their firearms at the woods. It was then that a multibear emerged from the tree line, standing in massive form over twice the agent's height. It spoke.\n\n”I have a meeting with the Mayor.”\n\nThey turned to each other for a moment, but did a quick call with their radio to command about it. With an approval from up above, they lowered their firearms and let the bear through. It ascended in quick order up the hill and was welcomed through the front door by an unphased butler. Entering a large den, the butler entered with the bear and walked towards the wheelchair facing away. He wheeled its occupant over to the bear.\n\n”I see you have come. What can I do for your kind that raised me?” asked Mayor Befufftlefumpter.\n\nJohn Multibear made his case. The Manotaurs intend to launch a full attack along the northern River Trembley. They needed weapons and supplies to repel the attack. Befufftlefumpter nodded, but seemed hesitant to intervene. Even a man once as powerful as him now must bow to other forces. Even a Blind Eye can see. But he was not unsympathetic. He agreed to help. The amount was not high as John would have liked, but perhaps its quality would make the difference. That’s always been the case of Franco-German Engineering.\n\nHe gave his thanks to the adopted son of his people."
