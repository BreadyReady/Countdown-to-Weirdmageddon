DTH_flavor.1.t:0 "Eugene's Project"
DTH_flavor.1.d:0 "Eugene Alisach, or as he's more referred to "Leader Eugene," has a great dream. One day, shortly after graduating from [HGH.getname], he set out to unite the various myths and legends of the forest into one unified canon.\n\nAt first he consulted the archives of the libraries he was most familiar with. When he realized that his libraries didn't have the material he was looking for, he set out and consulted libraries from the Tsardom's to Skywynne's and everything in between. When he realized that their material was hopelessly out of date, biased, or the libraries didn't let him in at all, he realized he'd have to get his hands dirty.\n\nThus he founded the [root.getname] in the outer springs of the swamp. Through his canon-in-development, knowledge of psychology, and extreme luck, he managed to get a small but devout group of followers. Enough to effectively control the heart of the forest, and not much else.\n\nUs followers would gladly follow him unto death, but Leader Eugene doesn't seem dedicated enough to lead us into it. In fact, he doesn't seem dedicated to his own cause at all. He sulks in his study looking at his mewman imported magic mirror all day, either scrolling through "Read-it," which we can only assume is some sort of intellectual/literature forum, or using some sort of war-simulator.\n\nWe aren't mad at him for it. He is only the messenger after all. But he's going to leave soon, he just needs a reason. Until then, we practice our faiths in the way Leader Eugene recommends. It's not hard to do, as it's mostly what we've already been doing to praise our gods."
DTH_flavor.1.a:0 "Hail to Leader Eugene!"

DTH_flavor.2.t:0 "Touching Grass"
DTH_flavor.2.d:0 "Eugene was looking down at his mirror, making a comment on Read-it referencing the "Swamps of Dagobah," presumably some geographical location, the advisor next to him presumed. They were traveling on a horse-drawn carriage. After their attempted settlements of unorganized places, everyone close to Eugene agreed that he had to go out and inspect the cult's lands. Despite Eugene's wishes.\n\n"Come oooon Eugene, you haaaad to get out of that place someday." The advisor, a monster called J-Frog, said. "Besides, it's nice to get out once in a while, right?"\n\n"I'm getting out of this place, alright." Eugene grumbled.\n\n"Hm? What do you mean, man?"\n\n"Wait, I haven't told anyone? I swear I... nevermind. I guess you have the honor of knowing first. Then the driver will know second, cuz of sound waves. I'm leaving this dimension, I have a major job offer elsewhere."\n\nJ-Frog was surprised, but at the same time it was expected. Leader Eugene's lack of dedication wasn't a secret. "Oh, bummer dude." was all that he could say.\n\n"Yeah, I got offered a job at the Wanderer's Library. God, it still feels unbelievable to say that-" The carriage suddenly stopped, making them jolt forwards. "Hey, why'd we stop?"\n\nThey heard footsteps approach their door. It swung open, and three monsters stood armed to the teeth.\n\n"Hands up and get out!" They were getting robbed.\n\nThey immediately complied. They were thrown to the ground, Eugene's face being pushed into the grass. The robbers emptied their pockets and the carriage, taking the only thing of value which was Eugene's magic mirror.\n\n"So boss, what'll we do with em?" One of the goons said.\n\n"Kill em. They're not of any importance-""
DTH_flavor.2.a:0 ""Hey!" Someone behind them shouted. "What're you doing to the Leader!?""

DTH_flavor.3.t:0 "Three Choices"
DTH_flavor.3.d:0 "Eugene sat in his tent looking over some notes he'd made of his potential successors. There were three options.\n\nOzzie Zipp. AKA "The Mosquito." She was an early recruit of the cult, and she's been sorting his mail and helping him in any way she can. She's very hard working, and she's made her way up the ranks. She seems a bit unstable.\n\nJonas Jackson. AKA "J-dog." A more recent recruit to the cult, he's supplied the cult with various... substances. His outlook on religion and spirituality is very compatible with most other's, taking on a generic forest holiness doctrine. He seems a bit too accommodating and non confrontational.\n\nJanna Ordonia. AKA "Janna Banana." A very recent recruit to the cult, she hasn;t had the chance to show how she would help the cult herself. However, she has many powerful connections. She also has extensive knowledge of the occult. She seems a bit unenthusiastic and relaxed at running the cult, but that might just be her way of talking.\n\nSo, who will it be?"
DTH_flavor.3.a:0 "Ozzie"
DTH_flavor.3.b:0 "J-Frog"
DTH_flavor.3.c:0 "Janna"

DTH_flavor.4.t:0 "Janna's Council"
DTH_flavor.4.d:0 "J-Frog was sitting in his chair and partaking in the consumption of hemp. To the left of him was another person, a person chosen by Janna to meet in this place. To the right was another. He and a few dozen other people had formed a semi-circle of tables, and in the open side was an empty chair just slightly more resplendent than the others.\n\n"So, uhh..." J-Frog looked around. "Do we wait another few hours or...?"\n\n"Ok this is ridiculous!" Ozzie Zipp said, "We've been waiting for two days straight. Clearly, Janna intended something else when she assembled us. Let's start brainstorming."\n\n"Hm... maybe this is a test of loyalty. I say we wait for another two days."\n\n"No no, you got it all wrong! Clearly, this is a meditation exercise meant to clear our minds. Janna is already leading us, despite her not being here!"\n\nThe group erupted into discussion. Eventually, J-Dog took another hit of his joint and spoke up. "What if... Janna... got us together... to run the cult?"\n\nEveryone fell silent. "What?" One person said.\n\n"What if we're like... meant to be sort of a council? Janna clearly isn't coming to run the cult soon..."\n\n"J-Dog." Ozzie slowly said. "You just might be a genius. Everyone in favor of running the cult until Janna gets here, say 'Aye!'"\n\n"Aye!"\n\n"Aye!""
DTH_flavor.4.a:0 ""Wait, we're a democracy?""

DTH_flavor.5.t:0 "New Dream Catcher"
DTH_flavor.5.d:0 "Soon-to-be-no-longer-the Leader Eugene Alisach loaded the last of his luggage onto his carriage. He took one last look at his people. Everyone came out to look at him as he left. All that he's worked for these past few years was here. All these people, following his works. His doctrine. His words. Him.\n\n"Uhm, Leader Eugene?" J-Frog tapped his shoulder. "That's everything. I think it's time. You should be able to get to the Mewni portal nexus by sunset."\n\nEugene turned to face him. "I think I agree- OH WHAT IS THAT!?" He looked up at J-Frog's hat.\n\n"Oh, this?" J-Frog pointed up at his hat. "It's my dreamcatcher/crown hybrid! I figured I needed it, since I'm becoming the boss."\n\n"J-Frog, y-... you know that the Black Sun, right!?"\n\n"'Black Sun?' Woah, sounds cool!"\n\n"N- No! It's not cool! Not cool at all! It was used by Himmler!"\n\n"'Himmler?' What's that?"\n\n"He was- Oh never mind..." Eugene sighed and climbed up on the carriage. "Well everyone... I guess this is goodbye." He looked out in silence over his people. "Remember, follow J-Frog's words, facts don't care about your feelings, and... and don't be too sad."\n\nHe rode off, waving to his somber people until they disappeared."
DTH_flavor.5.a:0 "Once they were out of sight, he began to cry as well."

DTH_flavor.6.t:0 "Sneaking A Peek"
DTH_flavor.6.d:0 "A new recruit was delivering some paperwork to Ozzie Zipp, the new leader. But there was a problem. Noone knew where she was. But eventually, the new recruit did find her tent on their own.\n\n"Uh... hello?" They peeled back the tent flap, and Ozzie hunched over something. Ozzie’s back was facing them, so they couldn't get a clear look. There was a sound like sucking a straw when the cup was empty. "Leader Ozzie? What’re you doing?"\n\nOzzie slowly and unsmoothly looked over her shoulder. Her eyes twitched, independently from each other. There were ragged, weak breaths coming from... her?\n\n"I’m having a celebration." She whispered. "Go away." There was a metallic smell coming from her."
DTH_flavor.6.a:0 "The recruit closed the tent flap, and backed away."

DTH_flavor.7.t:0 "First Impressions"
DTH_flavor.7.d:0 "They all looked back to see who it was. It was a Mewman looking girl, with dark hair and a murky green beanie. "It's nunya business!" One of the goons shouted.\n\n"This looks like a lot of my business." She unwrapped a lollipop and stuck it into her mouth. "Tell ya what, you let go of both of them, tie yourselves up, and turn yourselves in, then I'll let you live. Maybe."\n\nThe robbers laughed. "Look at you! You are tiny little girl!" One of the goons said in a thick [TSR.getname] accent. He approached her. "Let me show you how it is done, then you can go and run home to your AHH-"\n\nIn one swift movement, she grabbed his arm and pinned him to the ground. As he struggled against her, everyone else took a step back in shock. This made them unhand the Leader, although he didn't have the courage to stand up.\n\n"You believe me now?" She said smugly.\n\n"Da! Yes!" He struggled harder. "Just let go!"\n\n"Hm, I dunno... you don't sound desperate enough for me to let go." She twisted his arm.\n\n"ACH! THIS WASN'T PART OF THE-" She let go of him, silencing him in relief.\n\n"All of you, run off!" She stood up, her foot still keeping the robber below her pinned down."
DTH_flavor.7.a:0 "The robbers turned tail and ran as fast as they could."

DTH_flavor.8.t:0 ""I Have My Ways"
DTH_flavor.8.d:0 ""Oh... oh my god..." Eugene stood up, legs wobbly. He got his magic mirror from the ground, thankfully undamaged. "That was exactly like in the avengers movies when-"\n\n"Please, sir, I think it would be best to thank our savior first."\n\n"Oh, yes!" He walked over to the girl, who was still keeping the robber pinned down below her. Eugene shook her hand. "Thank you so much! What's your name?"\n\n"Janna." She said, "Janna Ordonia. Can I get a ride to your camp? I've heard about you, and I wanna join your cult.\n\n"Alright then, no problem! Just hop on when you're ready." Eugene got onto the carriage.\n\nJ-Frog talked to her next. "Hey. So..."\n\n"Thanks for pressuring Eugene into going out today." She pulled out a large bundle of cash. "Distribute these to everyone in high command. Equally. I'll know if you didn't."\n\n"I don't doubt that, dudette." He took the money and got on the carriage. Before he got fully inside, he asked "You need a ride to camp? I know you wanna do more stuff with us."\n\n"Don't worry 'bout me. I have my ways."\n\nOnce he got in and they rode off, she took out another wad of cash. She handed it to the robber pinned down to the ground below her. "And this is for robbing him at the right place and the right time."\n\n"Spasibo. Thank you. I will distribute as well. But... can you please let me go?""
DTH_flavor.8.a:0 ""Hm... five more minutes.""

DTH_change_tree.1.t:0 "Job Offer"
DTH_change_tree.1.d:0 ""Leader Eugene?" A monster in a black hooded robe was holding a stack of letters and a box infront of a tent. It was 1:00 pm.\n\n"Ugh... Who is it?" Eugene had awoken just an hour before. He was groggy, and had refused to go out of his tent yet.\n\n"Ozzie Zipp, your 21st follower!" Eugene was scrolling Read-it, discussing some old important text, she presumed.\n\n"Who?"\n\nOzzie's right eye twitched as she forced a smile. "The Mosquito."\n\n"Oh right, my mail!" Eugene peeked out of his tent. "Who even uses snail mail anyway? Ah whatever, give me the summary as you hand me the mail, as you always do."\n\n"Alright. Junk mail, your Nat-Geo magazine, some sort of... body pillow with a graphic case-"\n\n"Gimme that!" Eugene grabbed the box where the pillow case was. "Ok, you're dismissed. And tell everyone not to disturb me! I need to concentrate. For intellectual purposes." He closed up his tent flap.\n\n"Hang on Leader Eugene, there's one more thing. I think it'll be best for you to read this yourself." She tapped the tent flap with a letter. Leader Eugene rapidly opened a small portion of the flap and snatched the letter.\n\nInside the dark, messy tent, he ripped open the letter in one hand and held the box in another. He read through the letter quickly, just wanting to see his body pillow.\n\nHowever, when he realized what the letter said, he dropped his box in shock.\n\n"M-... Mr. Alisach..." He read aloud, voice trembling. "You have been selected for employment in the W-... Wanderer's Library!?"\n\nWorking at the Wanderer's Library was an impossibility. Why would the largest library in interdimensional existence, an entire dimension dedicated to archiving, employ some socially awkward nerd? And yet here it was, a job offer in his hands."
