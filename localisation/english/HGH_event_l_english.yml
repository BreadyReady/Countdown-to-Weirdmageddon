HGH_flavor.1.t:0 "The Learned Principal"
HGH_flavor.1.d:0 "Terrance Terhalis was an ambitious young turtle. Born in Murky Village, he traveled the Swamps and Forests doing odd jobs and using his money to get educated. Eventually, he hid inside a Mewman carriage and went interdimensional. Long story cut incredibly short: He went extraordinarily far, he did extraordinarily exciting odd jobs, and he got an extraordinary education. He returned to Mewni at 60 years old with enough stories to tell for 6 generations.\n\nBefore, he would find the monster's living conditions fine. But after seeing the multiverse, he saw it as unacceptable. And so he founded Forest High. A place where all monsters can receive an education and have a chance at bettering their life. Maybe even make it off Mewni.\n\nEventually, communities started forming around the school. They started giving the school donations on a regular basis. They gave the school land to expand. Some of them even pledged their allegiance. Over the course of 20 years, the school went from a small building to a genuine state. A state which never intended to become one, but a state nonetheless.\n\nPrincipal Terhalis is now 80 years old. But that ambition of his youth has never left him. His species lives 200 years, after all. There's still more to come."

He put a megaphone to his mouth and began to speak.\n\n"Hello, new freshmen!" He had adopted the American convention of grade-naming from his time on earth. "Welcome to Forest High! This style of mass-education may be new to some of you, but you will get used to it. So, how are we feeling today?"\n\nThe crowd cheered and clapped.\n\n"That's good to hear! You'll get details inside, schedule, rules, etcetera. Now, word of advice: Today is the start of something great. The start of your future! Don't squander it, this is your chance to move up in life! To be something important! If you can't remember all that, just remember these words:""

HGH_change_focus_tree.2.d:0 "Principal Terhalis sat at the end of the long conference table. To the left and right of him teachers, village representatives, accountants, mechanics, the student body, and more were discussing the future of the High School.\n\nThis meeting reminded him of his time away from Mewni, when he managed to get into some interdimensional emperor's court as an advisor. He was then kicked out of said court for creating a gigantic embezzling network. He remembers the last words he said to the emperor, "Go ahead, exile me, you can't unembezzle your treasury!" He left the emperor with a massive corruption problem. Good times, good times.\n\nHe sat in silence, just listening. He heard a common demand, that the School should centralize and become a legitimate state. As the student body began to speak, Principal Terhalis stood up.\n\n"I have heard your pleas, and I believe it is time to start consolidating power-" The floor creaked beneath him. Then he felt the foundation crack, then the floor bent down like jelly. "AHHH-"\n\nThe entire floor collapsed, taking everyone with it.\n\nThere were no survivors."

He had heard of a group of people who were trying to bring stability to the school. He didn't hear much, and for all he knew they could just be another gang, but he had a gut feeling about them. They were led by Emmie Ester, and from what he remembers she was a stand-up girl before the collapse.\n\nHe came upon a door with its window blocked with a piece of paper. On it, a blue and white symbol of a circle with wheat crops going around it. This was the place. He opened the door with a creak, and what he saw amazed him.\n\nHe saw people in clean clothes, cordially and calmly speaking. There were guards who stood there watching, not using their position of power to extort anyone. They noticed him, but they didn't immediately kick him out.\n\n"Uhm, we are having a council meeting right now." Emmie said. "You could come again after it if you wanna join us."\n\nHe nodded, and retreated. Here was something the people could believe in, something the people could look up to. And from the few other people coming his way, it seemed the word had already spread."

Everyone was buzzing about the play, it would be the first bit of entertainment they'd have that wasn't just drinking bootleg alcohol made from juice boxes. Everyone was cordial, a far cry from the normal savagery that is the aftermath of Principal Terhalis' death.\n\nThe lights in the room suddenly dimmed, interrupting the conversations everyone in the room was having. The announcer, a monster named Neville Knickerton, walked on stage. "H– Hello? Can you guys hear me?" They said into their microphone. "Uh... huh- Hi... welcome to the play, I guess..." He made everyone die internally but regardless they watched.\n\n"The performance will be of... Guys, was I really the only one available? I organize, I don't do announcements..." He whispered to somebody off stage. "Whatever. We're performing Jomeo and Ruliet. I- We hope you like it."\n\nHe walked off stage as the lights dimmed. The play commenced, a bizarre story about two lovers coming back from the dead and then growing apart. The people loved it though, and when the show ended people felt a little bit more connected to each other. It was enough to stabilize the school, all thanks to Neville Knickerton."
change_focus_tree_3_scripted_loc_band_kids:0 "In the slums of Forest High that formed after Principal Terhalis died, a gang was wreaking havoc upon the people. Robbing, extortion, etc. As they walked between the tents, people cowering at their gaze, they came upon a defiant group of people. They were formed in a line.\n\nOne of the gang members stepped forward. "Who the heck do you think you are-"\n\n"AVENGERS!" One of the defiant said. "ASSEMBLE!" They all outstretched their arms to their sides.\n\n"...What the heck is this-"\n\n"T-POSE." They all said in perfect unison. "TO ASSERT DOMINANCE."\n\n"Wha- I- Ugh, whatever! I’m ditching this place." The gang member left, and so did all the others.\n\nThe disheveled people slowly came out of their tents, and started thanking their saviors. However, all they said in response was "SUB TO PEWDIEPIE""

Everything was going smoothly, it was unusually stable for Forest High, which was in a state of anarchy ever since Principal Terhalis died. However, that changed when a group of people came up to the vendor. One of them, a Lizard monster, starts robbing the vendor.\n\nThe crowd notices and starts crowding the gang. Even the game stopped as the players came to see what was happening. The Lizard panicked and threatened to cast a magical spell (Although he didn’t have any idea on how to do so.) J.J. Jackson, the lead player of the Boars, stepped in a little too close causing the Lizard to jump on him. J.J. took on the gang, 6-1,and in the end J.J. came out on top.\n\nWith this victory, the people of Forest High looked up to him while the crooks and the baddies feared him. Single handedly, he started to bring stability back to Forest Highschool."
change_focus_tree_3_scripted_loc_yearbook_club:0 "In the chaos that was the aftermath of Principal Terhalis' death, various gangs had formed and started exploiting the people. But today, all these gangs had convened in one room for one reason: Money. Each of their leaders had been given 500 dollars, and they were promised 500 more if they came to this room and accepted Candice Sneki's proposal.\n\nCandice Sneki walked in, phone in her hand and lollipop in her mouth. She scanned the room and smiled. Everyone had come. "Alright, lemme give it to ya straight." She put her phone in her pocket, an unprecedented move. "If all y'all teamed up, y'all could run. This. Place. So lemme tell y'all the deal: You fellas unite under me, i'll make sure all y'all will grow. More money, more power, more everythin'! So, what'd'y'all say?"\n\nThe gang leaders and representatives looked at Sneki, then at each other, then back at Sneki. Most of them looked reluctant. In fact, all of them did.\n\nSneki looked back at them "...I'll give you 500 dollars."\n\nThe room immediately erupted in acceptance."

It was a common sight at this point, and nobody batted an eye in the slums that formed in the school courtyard. The robber threatened her with a knife. Surprisingly, she refused. So naturally he just pushed her to the ground and decided to take her money manually.\n\nBut as she was pushed down to the ground, somebody intervened. "Halt!" A wolf monster by the name of Shadow Hedgeblade slowly walked with an entourage of 'Soldat Truppen' behind him. He had a coat over his shoulders. "Are you robbing the poor Frau!? Shame on you, Degenerate!"\n\nBoth the girl and the robber stared at Shadow and his group in confusion. "Is... is that an iron cross-"\n\n"Shh, it'll be alright." Shadow interrupted the girl, then spoke to the thug. "I will give you a choice. Either you leave the Frauen alone and never return to this school, or my Soldat Truppen makes you do it. Choose wisely, Untermench. This is Shadow Hedgeblade you're dealing with here."\n\n"'Frauen...?' You mean the girl?" The thug laughed. "Look, it may be three to one, but I know weak, weird kids when I see them. I can tell just by your name and hairstyle!"\n\nShadow sighed and signaled one of his Truppen to fire a warning shot. They pulled out a Luger, and aimed.\n\nBANG.\n\nThey hit the leg. The robber yelped, crumpled, and started hopping away. "OH DUDE, FINE! I'LL LEAVE HER ALONE! JUST LEAVE ME ALONE TOO!"\n\n"I don't want to step foot near you ever again, Untermensch!" Shadow slowly walked over to the girl on the ground and held out his gloved hand. "Frauen?"\n\nThe girl looked at him, then at his hand, then took it. "Oh god, I can't thank you enough, Shadow!"\n\n"Any good Aryan would've done the same." Shadow smiled. "And please, call me der Fuhrer." At this point, Shadow noticed everyone staring at him. So he let go of the girl's hand and began to speak.\n\n"That goes for all of you! Listen to my words carefully; we will bring stability back to Forest High! And we will bring it under a new Aryan banner!"\n\nThe people then shouted in unison, "Heil Hedgeblade! Heil der Fuhrer!""
