    stantastic.1.d:0 ""Hey Mr. Pines! Ready for some "Toss me a Dozen Eggs"?" asked the local market clerk.\n\n"Send them my way, Jimmy!"\n\nStan strolled through the fresh produce section of the grocery store as he caught one egg after the other. With his quick sleight of hands, Stan didn't need to see through his cataracts to grab them. It came as natural as though he was pickpocketing the air itself.\n\nHumming himself a little tune, he rounded a corner to get to the corn, but was stopped by a small child with white hair nearly as tall as the cart.\n\n"Hello there, Stanford Pines!"\n\n"Gideon!"\n\n"I see you wanted some corn? Well too bad!" He snapped his fingers and his father Bud rushed over and slid the entire display of corn into their cart, "This corn is all mine!"\n\n"You little monster!"\n\nBud asked, "Uh, Gideon, what exactly do we need this corn for-"\n\n"Enough Questions!" He gestured to be picked up and placed in the cart seat, "Now drive old man!"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBack at the Shack, Stan slammed his fist on the table in front of the console to the portal. As he grumbled about where to buy corn now, one of his many series of notebooks slipped off from the shelf and opened up. Stan took a look at it.\n\n"Huh? Glossaryck still owes be 50 Mewni Sols from that poker game last yea- Wait a minute, Mewni! They have corn coming out of their ears! Of course!""

    stantastic.2.t:0 "Free for the Taking"
    stantastic.2.d:0 "From the deep depths under the Mystery Shack, Stan emerged onto a land with a bright sun and an exotic sky. He paid no mind to the plants and astroids high above, the pink sky around him, or the castle in the distance. In front of him as a field of corn and a magical shield surrounding it. With him was an overly sized bag and a bundle of Dynamite he 'borrowed' from McGucket.\n\nHe rushed over to where a line of worker rats were using a hole in the shield to get corn.\n\n“Get! You filthy magic rats!”\n\nStan easily scared them off. He planted the Dynamite on the hole, lit the fuse and made a mad dash to the bushes at the outskirks of the woods near by. He took cover, only to notice two monsters next to him.\n\n"Hey, hows it going?"\n\n“Uhm... good, I guess?” replied Buff Frog.\n\nThe explosion went off, leave a trail of dust and a larger hole in the shield. Stan rushed back out anmd jumped in. Fatser than an army of rats, he swiped each and every cob of corn from their stalks until his bag was twice his own size. Bag first, he shoved it out the hole and jumped out as well as it return to a smaller size. As he took out his small garage remote to reopen the portal, Stan could overhear someone yelling at him.\n\n"Stanford Pines! Come back with my Corn!""
    stantastic.2.a:0 ""Suck it, Rivers! It’s my corn now! Send my regards to the missus!""
    
    stantastic.14.t:0 "Corn you glad you met me?"
    stantastic.14.d:0 "Stan pressed the button on his remote... and nothing happened. As he quickly kept pressing it, kights quickly converged on his location. Prepared for a fight, he dawned his bronze knuckles and quickly engaged them. Even in his old age, Stan dodged sword swings and thrust and delivered a power punch at each knight he faced. The monsters in the bush watched in shock as Stan took them down and return to his stolen corn. But as he turned away, one more warrior of Mewni arrived.\n\n“Well, well, well... well well, well, well, well. If it isn’t Stanford Pines!”\n\nHe turned back, shocked, "Mina! I thought you were roaming the multiverse?"\n\n"Oh I do some travel," Mina Loveberry said, smiling as she checked her nails, "But I pop in on my beloved Mewnie from time to time. And what luck do I have, to find you here? A Stump Day Miracle!"\n\n"Hehe, well," He pointed the remote at her, "Stay back Mina. You know very well what I’m capable of!"\n\n"Pfft, you’re a human. What can you do against Queen Solaria’s greatest warrior?!"\n\nAs they faced off, Rivers finished setting up a catapult on the balcony. He finished a bite from a corncob he had in his mouth and yelled out. "Stanford Pines! Get away from my Corn!" Rivers launched a burning boulder towards Stan. He cowered as Mina watched. But the flaming boulder was short in power and distance, and landed on the shield itself. It bounced off the magic shield, changing its trajectory. They both looked up as the boulder went back up into the air and landed right on top of Mina Loveberry, squashing her."\n\nRivers looked on in shock and slowly hid away, "Oops..."\n\nStan burst out laughing, "Oh, oh that. That’s just rich, hahaha." As Mina struggled to crawl from under the boulder on top of her, Stan walked over and placed a Mr. Mystery Bobblehead next to her. "Here you go, a gift from Earth’s Man of Mystery! And a bumper sticker for your, uh, rock here." Something on Mini’s person caught his eye. He reached over and grabbed her scissors. "Also, I’m going to borrow this. I don't need a chase now."\n\nStan slapped the sticker on the rock. He walked away and aimed his remote at the space in front of him. A portal opened up, and he quickly walked in to make his exit from Mewnie."

    stantastic.4.d:0 "King River walked out onto the balcony, eating a cob of corn. With his mouth full of the golden pride of Mewni, he looked out to survey the land of the kingdom. Beyond in the horizon were the southern mountains. Before them in the distance was the great Mewni River. And finally, beneth his view was the vast corn fields of the Butterfly Kingdom. It was as he looked down, he saw a strange figure lurking in the distance on the very edge of the magical shield protecting the corn. A man in a black suit and a red fez. Before River could take out his binoculars, there was an explosion! He turned to see who was so bold and daring to steal from the Butterflys by themselves.\n\n"It's him again! What was his name again, Stanny Bines? Come back with my Corn, Stanny!"\n\n"Stan Bines" yelled out in response, "Suck it, Rivers! It’s my corn now! Send my regards to the missus!"\n\nQuickly, he ordered his knights in to engage. Watching from above, he wasn't shocked to see the multi-dimentional thief that alluded capture for years quickly evade his knights. River rushed back inside.\n\nA few minutes later, he came back out with a catapult loaded with a lit tar bar.\n\n"Stanny Bines! Get away from my Corn!"\n\nAs he launched it, he noticed that Mina Loveberry herself had cornered Stan. He then noticed the fireball. It fell short and bounced off the shield. Then it squashed Mina instead!\n\n"Oops..."\n\nHe hid for a bit, still hearing "Stanny" laughing at him and Mina. When he turned to look, he was gone and so was the corn he stole."

    stantastic.5.d:0 "For the effort he went through, making a dump unicorn from mewni corn would be waste. Mewni corn is as yellow as its value in gold. Driving in the middle of the night to a shady part of Gravity Falls, he arrived at an abandon building. Slipping fake pointy ears on, he knocked on the door.\n\n"Go away" said the bouncer through the small sliding slit. Stan held up the corn to his eyes. "What is that?"\n\n"Corn... Mewni Corn."\n\nQuickly he was let in and he descended down into the Crawlspace, a hidden paranormal market underneath Gravity Falls. Whatever he needed here, he'll find it. And he had the perfect currency.\n\nThere was an assortment of different sellers and buyers roaming the market. He took note to keep his eyes from glancing at anyone the wrong way, as he could not afford any mishap. But he did get intrigued by some of the things he saw. There were witches selling hands and shady robed figures selling scrolls with people’s memories. One seller in a green trench coat had his wall filled with the faces of unsuspecting humans and creatures that were foolish enough to bargain with it. Every dark corner seemed to have a shady transaction going on, with a sun glassed gnome and a scared unicorn being the most notable. But as he walked through the crawlspace, he focused on who he was going to meet and what he wanted.\nBut there was one thing to catch his eyes and shift them towards it. Along the walls were an assortment of wanted posters. Some were new, overlapping others such as the head of a goblin like creature with a standing hair style, sharp rectangle glasses and the aurora of being a great host for interviews. Another was of an older woman with eyes that clawed at what it stared and imposing grey hair. The finally one was even older. A man with glasses, brown hair, and his hand held out. There were six fingers.\n\nHe arrived at a large stand he was familar with. Dismissal from the clerks turned to full attention when he held the corn up. Ushered into the main tent in the back, he met its owner, a creature by the name of Mr. Kratin.\n\n"Ah yes. How good to see you again. I have the parts you need," he opened a secured briefcase holding special parts for the portal, "And I heard..."\n\nStan took out the corn, "You heard right. Corn stright from the Butterfly's personal corn field."\n\n"Marvelous! Lets... seal the deal, no?" \n\nAs they bargained, something caught his attention..."

She escaped, but left her precious staff behind."\n\n"I'll take it."\n\n"Its not for sale, I'm afriad."\n\nStan flicked his wrist, popping out a smoke bomb from under his sleeve, "Who said I'd pay for it?"\n\nHe toss the smoke bomb and filled the tent in air. In the confusion, he grabbed the corn, the portal parts, and the staff before bursting out the tent and intot he open market. Mr. Kratin's guards rushed out and gave Stan chase. In the ensueing chaos, he smashed his way through other stands and others joined in on the chase after him. He turned to the staff.\n\n"Ah dang it. What was it... Owl? Hooty? No wait, not that tube... Albert? Owlbert? Owlbert!"\n\nNo response. He rounded a corner and hid in an alley as others continued on. Taking out his Journal 1, Stan tried to find something about the isles. It was then Mr. Kratin and his guards quickly founded him.\n\n"Stanford Pines! I should have known. Your disguice of a cheap carny may have decieve me, but no longer!"\n\nBack into a corner, Stan held the staff out, "Don't make me use this!"\n\n"If I couldn't use it, what could you possibly do?""

    stantastic.15.d:0 "Stan turned the staff upward and plunged it into the ground. A bright light flashed out, blinding them all. Kratin and the guards stumbled back as Stan held on to the staff and stayed at placed. What followed was a moment of silence. As Stan’s chasers struggled to get back up, Stan opened his eyes to see what happened. Above the staff head, the there was a small single point of light. It slowly began to move and made a small circle, a ring above the staff. When the ring completed, a small scroll appeared and dropped form thing air as the ring disappeared. It bounced off the staff and Stan attempted to catch it, juggling it around for a bit. Looking at the scroll, it popped out of his hand and into the air. It unrolled itself and began playing a video.\n\n"Hey there Kratin! How’s it going? I see you attempted to make use of my ‘staff’. Hate to break it to you there, buddy. But while I got what I wanted; you didn’t get squat! Since I am a good sport though, I hope you enjoy this toy staff replica of my own. Now with realistic Owlbert chirping!" The bird palisman on the staff lit up like a toy and played a poor-quality audio of an owl chirping, "From yours truly, Eda."\n\nThe scroll rolled up and fell and Stan quickly caught it.\n\n"Huh… I’m impressed! You know, I actually tau-“\n\n“Enough!” Kratin stood up, “Guards, destroy him!”\n\nAll round the crawlspace, a series of small explosions rang out. There was screaming as people panic and new voices over a megaphone shouted out orders and warnings.\n\n“This is the Forest Council Special Task Force! You are all under arrest for black market activities and failure to report said black market activities on your tax forms!” They could all hear a side conversation as someone corrected the gnome speaking, “Oh, sorry. You are all also under arrest for a series of other highly illegal crimes. You know, the sort of thing.”\n\n“It’s the cops!” yelled Kratin.\n\n“If that isn’t my cue, I don’t know what is."\n\nStan grabbed his stuff and ran off as chaos engulfed the market. Thinking of an escape route, he remebered Mina's scissors! Taking it out, he tore a dimensional portal and jumped in, corn, parts, staff and all."

    stantastic.7.d:0 "“Huh, this is new...” Stan turned his head to see the peaceful temple he was in. He then noticed a small blue man in a yellow robe floating by in the air.\n\n“Stanford! I haven’t seen you in such a long time!”\n\nStan greeted him back, “Hey Glossarych. Nice digs you got here.”\n\n“Thanks Stan. I was thinking a darker hue, but the architect argued otherwise.”\n\n“Uh, how’s things?”\n\n“Oh good, good. I certainly wish I could say the same about you though.” He pointed behind Stan.\n\nStan turned around. At the entrance to the magic sanctuary were the members of the Magic High Commission and a squadron of Mewman Knights. From left to right stood Rhombulus, Hekapoo, Queen Moon, Lekmet, and Omnitraxus. All of them had their full attention on Stan.\n\nHe rolled his eyes, “Gee, Glossarych, thanks for the heads up.”\n\n“No problem, Stan. Bloop, bloop,” he said as he slowly sailed away from him while still hovering the air.\n\n“Stanford Pines!” Moon yelled out at him, annoyed over seeing him once again.\n\nHe nervously chuckled, “Ah, Moon! Good to, uh, see you again.”\n\nRhombulus interrupted, “That’s Queen Butterfly to you, buddy!”\n\nStan sighed in annoyance, “Sheesh, who invited this guy?”\n\nHekapoo turned to the rest of the commission, “Actually, that’s a good question. Who did invite Rhombulus here? This was a private ambush- Wait! He’s distracting us!” Hekapoo took out her custom sheers, “Give back the scissors!”\n\n“Well, geez. You could have just asked,” Stan pulled out the scissors and tossed it to the ground between them, “I only took them because, well. You know, Mina being crazy and all.”\n\nGlossarych floated by between them, “He does have a point.”\n\nMoon sighed, “And the corn?""

With Hekapoo's control of all magical scissors, they preapred for an ambush if the human thief ever used it. Oddly, Glossaryck insisted that the Sactuary itself be used as the location for the ambush, instead of some dungeon. With releuctance, as he still holds massive sway with the commission, they agreed.

He snatched the remote from him and floated away, tinkering with it.\n\n“No wait, ah!”\n\nStan jumped out of the way of another crystal beam, dropping the sack of corn. He held on to the fake staff and stumbled into the pond itself. Stan saw as he slowly sunk into the depths. He was outnumbered, outgunned, and in no position to fight back. A though passed his mind just to stop and let it end right there. As he thought about submitting to fate, he turned and noticed the staff was glowing, radiating across its frame with true power.\n\n“I haven’t seen that in... wait, that means!?”\n\nThe Commission walked over to the edge of the pond. From out of the water, Stan came bursting out, the staff propelling him up and into the air. He landed back onto the ground in between the Commission and the knights. He stood up, twirling his staff before planting it firmly on the ground.\n\nHekepoo groaned, “Great, he got empowered by the sanctuary’s water. Knights, get him!” The knights all rushed him at once, but Stan took his staff and waved it across them, unleashing an energy wave that knocked them all back.

Stan aimed for him and fired an energy blast, striking and launching him into the pond.\n\nMoon stood in place as the others charged in after him. Stan turned to them and began spinning his staff. A bright ring formed along the circumference of the spinning staff. As they got closer, he unleashed the remaining magical energy of the staff. An intense energy bean shot out from the formed ring and he waved it from left to right, clearing the commission off from the ground and ejecting them into the pond.\n\nStan finally stopped spinning it and leaned against it, exhausted."

As he peeled off and fell onto the ground, Moon approached him in her mewberty butterfly form.\n\n“Stanford. My patience grows thin,” she said to him, pointing all three of her right arms at him as her wings gracefully flapped in the air.\n\nStan stood back up, “Well that’s new...

He knew there were other ways from Owlbert’s world to travel here. Very far from home, but that never stopped her. “Look... uhm...” He reached into his coat and pulled out a bobblehead of himself. “Give this to her, would you?” He placed it down in front of Owlbert. The palisman took a moment to look at it before it grabbed it and placed it in the sack. Owlbert turned back to Stan and chirped in agreement. Stan stood up and watched as Owlbert dragged the sack into the wood and disappeared. He took a deep breath and sighed.

It started with Roswell when an alien ship blew up a weather balloon as a sort of interstellar prank, only to crash their ship in some cosmic karma retribution. The FPI had to move all alien sites to random locations outside the country thanks to all the journalists thinking the base was where the aliens were. Stan had to admit, making everyone think Area 51 had the aliens instead of a base on a deserted island in the Pacific was genius.\n\nHe pondered. 'If only I brought some souvenirs to sell to these suckers.'\n\nBut he had a mission. And now two ways in. There was a secret passage along the ridge to the west he normally used to sneak through and the distraction of the nerds raiding the entrance would ensure no one was guarding it. But alternatively, the base is understaffed since the Kerfuffle and he could just join the raiders and follow right behind them as they overwhelm the base. Stan thought to himself, it would be more fun."

    stantastic_51.4.d:0 "After a short hike through Papoose Mountain, Stan slid down the ridge approaching the west end of Homey Airbase. As he approached the perimeter, he ducked behind some crates as Federal Air Force MPs ran by. There were shouting, explosions, and a huge commotion on the other side of the base. As everyone turned their attention to the raiders, Stan quickly crossed the base and entered a door into the main hanger.\n\nAs red lights flashed and the air siren rang out outside, he reached the main office, abandoned in the distraction. File drawer by file drawer, he pulled out paperwork for anything about the waste. Quartermaster inventory, shipping manifestos, radiological reports. Nothing. This base wasn’t even serving as a storage depot anymore. An empty husk, no technology, no advanced exotic material, just a blip on the map to distract the populace. Anything useful was shipped out long before the kerfuffle, to other sites still useful on the continent. \n\nAs he sat down in exhaustion, he noticed two other reports. One, a material, Code Named- Sweat of Hercules. He read through it, realizing what the material really was. And he read the location. Fort Teller, Washington. Closer, but not any easier to approach as it housed the American SDI System. But even one drop can fuel his machine for another dozen years. The other report was a barrel of radioactive carbon retrieved from a STALKER for the FPI, still on-base after it had fallen off the truck near the gate when the last shipment left. He read the radiological samples. It was perfect. Not a lot of fuel, but enough for the meantime. At least he had a new site to scope out, and something to bring back home.\n\nTwo soldiers burst into the office. Stan stood up and raised his hands. He noticed their uniform and the armbands they wore. They weren’t Federal Soldiers, they were Californian, Imperial Soldiers. With no time to ponder how they are here, he slipped a smoke bomb from his coat and gassed the room. In the smoke, he fled and rushed to the main hangar wing. Looking at the second report, he got to the truck holding the barrel. Turning the engine on, he noticed a crate labeled ‘Corn Juice’. He shivered at the thought."

    stantastic_51.5.d:0 "As imperial soldiers began to open the hangers doors, General Sherman Pines walked over to watch. As the gap widened, Stan burst right through with the truck in full gear. General Pines ducked out of the way as the truck veered out of the way and crashed through some empty crates. The soldiers formed up around the general and prepared to open fire, but Pines raised his hand to hold fire. He turned to his XO, a marine major. He nodded his head, and she nodded back. She began to run after the truck.\n\n"Is that marine running after me?" Stan looked back before turning eyes forward, "Shermie’s right about those crayon-eating-" He looked at his rear view mirror. A bright light approached from behind at high speeds. He adjusted the mirror, focusing in on the source. A woman with two large wide moth wings, three arms on each side, approached him fast. He pondered, "Is that Moon?" Finally, she got close enough, the details of her marine formal uniform being made out, as well as her six hands charging for a blast.\n\n"By the authority of the Imperial California Republic, stop the vehicle immediately!"\n\n"Huh, it’s Emily... Oh no, Mewberty Emily!"\n\nA strong magic blast struck just behind the truck. Stan veered to the right, making it pass the blown out fence and into the desert. She let out another roar and flung her arms at the truck, unleashing another magic blast. Stan slammed the brakes to dodge the shot, then banked left to regain distance from her. With his niece in hot pursuit, he scoped the grounds around him for an escape route. Dodging another blast that nearly threw the truck clear, he reached into the crate for a drink of the corn juice. \n\nInstead, he pulled out a vial filled with a yellow substance. Grossed out for a moment, he released what it was, seeing the substance give an ever mute glitter.\n\n"Magic Water!"\n\nLooking back at the pursuing Emily Pines, he came up with a plan."

    stantastic_51.6.d:0 "Stan acted quickly. Grabbing what he could from the glove compartment, he locked the wheel and gas pedal in place. Opening the rear window on to the flatbed, he climbed out with the crate of "corn juice". With Major Emily Pines right behind him, Stan pulled out some vials began tossing the vials at her.\n\n"What the hell? Eww, gross!"\n\n"This is as awkward for me as it is for you!"\n\nStan kept tossing the crate's supply of magical water, each vial that hit coating her with the magic water, driving her back a bit. The magic of the water from the realm of magic slowly began to take its effect. Stan emptied out the crate, tossing out the last vials of water at her. Down to his last vial, he needed to make it count. All the while, Emily refocused her effort and grabbed the backgate of the truck, just mere feets away from grabbing him. Stan then pulled off his balaclava and revealed his face.\n\n"Emily!"\n\n"Uncle Stan?"\n\nDistracted, he threw the vial right at her, smashing dead center on her face. Glass shards scattered about in the high speed pursuit and the magic water drenched her. She stopped just before she grabbed hold of him. Stan looked on. Her eyes were wide open, her pupils replaced with bright glittering stars. She smiled at her uncle, worrying the old man, then she flew straight upward into the air. Stan looked on as she opened up a dimensional tear and disappeared through it. He broke out in laughter.\n\n"Ha! I’ll make it up to you for Christmas!"\n\nHe sat back down on the flatbed to rest. He stared at the barrel of radioactive carbon. Then something else struck him."

    stantastic_51.7.t:0 "Love and Grand Theft in Las Vegas"
    stantastic_51.7.d:0 "Stan flew forward when the truck drove itself right into a ditch. He tucked and rolled to cusion his landing. It was not the first time he had gotten himself ejected from a moving platform at high speeds. When he finally came to stop, he rolled over and stared up at the sky. Dark, peaceful. Nothing but rock, sand, and cactuses. He could make a bright light on the horizon. Sitting up, he realized it was Las Vegas in the distance.\n\nTaking a deep breath, he walked back to the truck. Seeing it stuck in the ditch outside Vegas, he began to ponder to himself. This wasn’t the first time he was here. His vehicle in a ditch after a lengthy car chase. Looking around, the land around him wasn’t too different as well. He looked up at the night sky once again. Squinting his aging eyes, he still made out that symbol he once knew so long ago, still being formed by the same stars, in both their worlds. Looking back at the truck, he laughed at himself.\n\n‘I guess I can’t blame you this time, huh?’\n\nHe took out that report he found and read it again. ‘The Sweat of Hercules’. Only someone strong, brave, and outright foolish like Hercules would try to get it once. Looking at the back of the truck and its single barrel of fuel, Stan realized he was even dumber than that greek prick. But if he wanted his brother back, he needed the Blood of the Titan to power the portal. Under lock and key, maybe he needed to go to the source. He picked up a rock and tossed it at the truck, missing entirley."

    stantastic_51.8.d:0 "Stan gathered with the group as they marched on the entrance onto the base proper. He stayed back at the end, having no intent to stick out among the rest or get shot by the guards. As they approached the gate, it exploded. More explosions could be seens along the gate perimeter, the shockwave knocking them down. In the shouting and sirens came the rumbling of machinery behind them. Over the hills, tanks appeared and stormed down the bludd towards the base. On the leading tank was the flag of California flying ever heroically. Norton’s empire was striking the base, using the raiders as a distraction.\n\nThe raiders disperse as tanks and infantry charged through the fence and into the base. Stan hid behind some bush as it all happened. As he watched, he saw a humvee stop nearby. Stan ducked his head as two people got out.\n\n‘Status on our forces?’ he asked.\n\n‘Swiftly advancing across the base. Seems Guzman’s files were right. A backwater location, the lights kept on to keep appearances. Most of the base personnel have already surrendered,’ she handed him a tablet, ‘We already downloaded the base’s manifest.’\n\nStan whispered to himself, ‘Manifest?’\n\nStan snuck around, approaching them from behind. He pulled over his balaclava and pulled out his taser. Ever quietly, he tiptoed right up to them. At the last moment, his taser charged, the woman turned around with a roundhouse kick in mid air. Stan dropped to the desert ground and rolled to the side as she dropped her boot straight down where his face was. Stan jumped back up, pushed his back in and charged forward. She easily dodged, grabbed his arm, and pinned him. He looked at her, chuckling as a smoke bomb fell off his sleeve.\n\nSmoke engulfed them and Stan broke free and tasered her. The man pulled out his side arm and pointed it at the smoke. The only thing that came out was his daughter falling to the ground. As he approached, Stan whacked him behind the head. He grabbed the tablet and took a moment to take a look at the two of them.\n\n'Shermie, Emily?! Ah geez, this is... *sigh* The next family reunion is going to be weird.'\n\nHe took the tablet. Radioactive carbon! Yes! And a material code named Sweats of Hercules? He’ll read it later. Now, undressing his older brother for his clothes and getting into the humvee, it's time to get that radioactive waste."

Soldiers either didn’t bat an eye or simply gave a quick salute to him as he drove right out the blown out front gate. After loading the barrel into his car, he hightailed it out of there and back to Las Vegas.\n\n‘If only marching into heavily guarded government facilities were that easy!’\n\nHe snickered at the thought and reached for a can of Pitt. As he drove into city lines, he took a drink and stared up at a passing billboard.\n\n‘Give Lady Luck a spin on the Cash Wheel! Auditions today at the Northwest Tower!’\n\nStan smiled. He already had what he wanted. Why not squeeze his luck for all its worth? Radioactive waste and winning a bet with his grandniece would truly be the best Las Vegas vacation he ever had."

Standing at the far end of the wheel, Rich Richardson and Carla Blanco walked out on set as the theme song of Cash Wheel played. With a little banter, they parted ways, Carla to the letter board and Rich to the contestants.\n\n‘Ladies and Gentleman! Welcome to, Cash Wheel!’ Rich smoothly pointed over to the three contestants, ‘Now lets meet those contestants!’\n\n‘I’m Doug, from Fairfield, California.’\n\n‘I’m Donna, from-’\n\n‘I’m Stan!

Money, radiation, winning a bet with a twelve year old girl, it didn’t get any better than that.\n\n‘I’m giving none of this to charity!’\n\nAs the crowd cheered on, Rich approached him, giving Stan the chance to beat even that accomplishment.\n\n‘And now you can go home a thousander.

They all gasped as the alarm went off.\n\n“Tick Tock! Time’s up kids!” He walked in and pointed at Mabel and Dipper, “Nice to see you learned how to dress while I was gone...”\n\n“How much did you beat us by?”\n\nHe tossed his briefcase on to the counter, “I won Six Hundred Thousand Dollars!” They all gasped. Stan chuckled and continued, “There I was...” he explained his story of how he reached the final round. The chance to double or nothing. A six letter word and the hint, what you say to ask for something politely. In front of national television, he turned to the crowd and laughed.\n\n“Oh please, this is eas-”\n\n“That’s it Stan. Please! You won!”\n\n“What?!”\n\nStan shrugged his shoulders and pointed at the stick on the cash register, “Apparently, that word can make you money. You got me there, Mabel.”\n\nMabel sighed, “I guess that means you win, Grunkle Stan.”\n\n“Hahah, I still got it! And I’ll be taking back control of the Shack. Please... and thank you.”\n\n“All that work, for nothing.”\n\n“As sweetie. Heavy is the head that wears this Fez,” Stan said, trying to confront her, “You did your best. It just wasn't good enough. And now, the last part of the bet.”"

    stantastic_the_bet.5.d:0 "Stan walked into the gift shop, still in his tank top and underwear. None of the tourists inside seemed to mind. One event took a selfie with him, thinking he was an attraction. Stan wasn’t sure to take it as a complement or not.\n\nHe turned to Wendy who was frantically trying to ring up all the customers.\n\n“Hey, where’s Mabel?” Stan asked.\n\n“I think she got bored with running the Shack and ran off with one of the boys visiting the gift shop,” she took off her hat and held it to her chest, “That poor kid...”\n\n“Wait, if she's done running the Shack...” Stan quickly ran out and back, now in his full suit, “Ladies and Gentleman, I am Mr. Mystery, owner and leader of the Mystery Shack. For a limited time only, the next tour is fifty... five, five percent off!”\n\nThere was almost a stampede as the crowd rushed towards Stan, cash and credit card in hand. Somewhere in the crowd, Soos was stuck, screaming for help. All the while Stan was more than happy to resume his role."
