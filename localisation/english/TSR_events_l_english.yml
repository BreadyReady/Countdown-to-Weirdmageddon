TSR_flavor.1.t:0 "Deal with the Devil"
TSR_flavor.1.d:0 "300 years ago the Mewman Queen Solaria Butterfly (Also known as the Scourge Of All That is Good, Obliterator of Monsterkind, General Poopyhead, and many other names.) went on a terrible campaign to rid Mewni of monsters. She mostly succseeded, annexing and replacing most monsters with Mewmans. We would have suffered the same fate if it were not for the diplomatic skills of Tsar Dehv-Awr-Deez of house Nuts, who made a deal with Solaria.\n\nHe would allow her armies to pass through his lands, and in return Solaria was not to attack the Tsardom. Although the resulting Mewman raids deeply scarred the monster memory, the result was that Solaria would never be able to conquer the forest on account of the Tsardom limiting Mewman supply lines."

Below the art the plaque read "In the name of the Tsarstvo Monstrov, the great knight Candishie of House dich-Fitin-joe-Mouf single-handedly held an enemy army for 12 days." The Patriarch took a closer look. The name of "Tsarstvo Monstrov" would not fit the Patriarch's vision for the Tsardom. A new name was in order. Perhaps "Blagoslovennoye Tsarstvo Monstrov?" No, too complicated. He needs something short and simple. "Patriarkhat Monstrov," that felt better. "Patriarkhat Monstrov i Lampa," to mention the holy Lamp directly by its name.

He didn’t even have a hat to keep his head warm, and Asty learned the hard way how cold the forests of the North could get.\n\nHowever, he remained determined. From what he understood, he’d be working closely with the Tsar on developing Cavalry. Even if he wasn't appreciated by his own rulers, he’d be appreciated by the monsters of the Tsardom. Still though, he wondered if he could make friends with the Monsters. He’d only talked briefly and professionally to their kind, and with him becoming part of the high command he’d have to work alongside them for long periods of time.\n\nBut he didn’t have to put up with any monsters for now. The halls were empty and he was wandering; they didn’t bother putting up big flashing neon signs pointing to the Tsar’s throne room. Did they even have the electricity for that? Asty doubted it. But even though they lacked basic amenities, he had to admit their architecture was beautiful. And as walked through and marveled at the colorful walls and banners, he saw a Mewman!\n\n"Excuse me, ma’am!" Asty waved to get her attention.\n\nShe was at the end of the hall. "Hm?"

The Mewman is clearly superior, and I'm tired of pretending they’re not!"\n\n"Well that may be... true..." The butler hated saying it, even if he didn’t mean it. "But Monsters are insulted when you say it! Can’t you get that, my Tsar? You’re a Monster too!"\n\n"I will admit, when I realized the truth I looked for any possible evidence to the contrary."
