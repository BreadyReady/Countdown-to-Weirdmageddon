Along with the increased §YNorthern§! and §GSouthern§! divisions, the Californian §1New Democratic-Republican Party§! is also divided.

Key area include the San Francisco Bay Area, the Central Valley, and the Sierra Nevada. Being also home to the capital of Sacremento, the North has always dominated state politics. To many, the north represents modern technological breakthrough and the heart of the old Wild West."
    cal_norton_south_approval_tt:0 "§GSouthern California§! is home to the southern ten counties of the state of California. With great urban sprawls and open deserts, the south is home to a majority of California and more critically, the entertainment capital of the World. To all, the image of palm trees, movie stars, and the entails of modern living is embodied in the south."
    cal_party_PIDR_tt:0 "The §4Progressive Imperial Democratic-Republicans§! consist primarily of the liberal wing of the NorCal NDR. Making up the Bay Area and the Sacremento Valley, and thus the majority of NorCal's population, they control the high sectors of the economy. The Progressives rally to Norton on his (by 19th century standrds) progressive view. Appealing to them will ensure overall stability, manpower, and economic support to the state."
    cal_party_TIDR_tt:0 "The §RTraditional Imperial Democratic-Republicans§! consist primarily of the conservative branch of the NorCal NDR. Consisting of the rural parts of Northern California, they make up for lower numbers in thier access to the key resources the state needs now that interstate commerce has collapsed. The Traditionalist rally to Norton on his anti-Trembley stance and his Imperial Presitge of a better America. Appealing to them will ensure overall war support, resource collection, and regional security from the likes of the Western FPI or Oregon."
    cal_party_MNDR_tt:0 "The §8Moderate New Democratic-Republicans§! consist of the SoCal NDR party. Though just as divided as their northern counterparts, they are kept together by Lieutenant Governor Diaz-Guzman and won't overreact when low in approval.\n\n Still, many are openly concerned of the election upset and though they are upset the north voted in Norton by a massive margin, Norton did also win SoCal by a slim margin. As Southern California has a larger population and sends more representatives, gaining thier support will mend the NorCal/SoCal divide and ensure overall stability and fuction of California in the long run."
