 FPI_cognito:0 "Minority Share Holder"
 FPI_cognito_desc:0 "The FPI, at one point, secretly controlled the world. We were not very good at it and we're still shredding paperwork about how we accidently caused World War 2. Stupid Himmler and his Super Aryan Fried Chicken. Since we began Operation Multi-Bear in the 60s, we span off that division into private entities like Cognito Inc and the Illuminati, to which we own a large minority share. As long as the stock dividends come in and they stay out of interdimensional affairs, they can operate as they please."

 FPI_consequence:0 "Consequence Of The Past"
 FPI_consequence_desc:0 "Operation Multi-Bear was Director B's Grand Vision of protecting our world from the multiverse. We launched thousands of incursions across numerous planes of reality, led by our top agents Andrew Chiu and Hector Diaz. Though Director B claims we were successful in keeping the multiverse from attacking Earth, the chaos we caused will surely come back to haunt us. From what records we have left from Director B, all we really did was make an "internal" threat even worse."
 
 FPI_MI13:0 "The All-Seeing Eagle and the Jester's Crown"
 FPI_MI13_desc:0 "The events in Gravesfield, Connecticut in the 1600s gave birth to what is now known as the American FPI and the British MI-13. Since WW1, we worked together under Taskforce Atlantis, fighting back paranormal activities and more. But after the disaster of Operation Hercules, our split-up has disorganized global anti-paranormal activities ever since. Also, no one tell the 05-Council we're cutting the SCP's budget... again."
 
 FPI_division:0 "Thousand Year Ache"
 FPI_division_desc:0 "When the FPI found Amarin and Shroud decades ago, these teenage girls were scarred by what happened in their time in an unknown dimension full of sentient amphibians. The near thousand-year time displacement didn’t help. But as then Director B concluded that King Andrias was not a threat to Earth, what happened was never really explored. Now, Director Amarin and Deputy Director Shroud will get the chance to confront what happened then, and what’s happening now in Amphibia."
