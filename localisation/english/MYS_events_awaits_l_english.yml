Stuck in town by the crowds converging for Pioneer Day, the two joined with everyone else as they celebrated the founding of their town. At the center stage, Sheriff Blubs announced the start of the commencement ceremony. Deputy Durland rang his bell to Blubs amusement as an old lady was being robbed.\n\nAfterward, Pacifica Northwest took the microphone, “Howdy, everyone! You all know me, Pacifica Northwest, great-great granddaughter of town-founder, Nathaniel Northwest. I'm also very rich.” The crowd cheered for her, “Now if you've got the pioneer spirit, we ask you come on up and introduce yourself!”\n\nMabel was enticed by the thought of audience participation. Dipper was to quick to remind her that Pacifica was her arch enemy, though Mabel dismissed it was water under the bridge. She rushed the stage, to the great displeasure of Pacifica. With a quick chant, she almost stole the crowd as they chanted “USA!”, bringing some to tears.\n\nPacifica was quick to strike Mabel down, “I'm sorry to break it to you, but Pioneer Day is for serious people, and you look and act ridiculous.”\n\n“Hey, I can be serious!” Mabel countered.\n\n“You do have nachos hanging from your ears, hon,” the remark swiftly struck Mabel’s feelings, “I'm embarrassed for you.”"

Mabel felt utterly ashamed of her ‘silly’ antics and bitter at how Pacifica put her down. Dipper couldn’t stand Pacifica’s attitude also and when he turned to look art her ancestor’s statue, he realizes he might have the answer. Turning to the Journal, he read about how Nathanial Northwest wasn’t the founder of the town, and the secret was in a document the author couldn’t decode. Excited to expose Pacifica as a fraud, Dipper set out to figure out the secret. Mabel quickly joined him, determine to show how serious a person she can be in uncovering this conspiracy.\n\nFrom behind the statue, Sheriff Blubs reported into his walkie-talkie.\n\n“This is Sheriff Blubs. We've got a code sepia!”\n\nOn the other end, across the country, a bored FPI agents was startled by the radio coming alive about a code sepia. He rushed to respond, “What?! And what are you doing about it?”\n\n“I'm following them right now,” answered Blubs.\n\nThe agents made his instruction clear, “Find them and stop them. There's no room for error.”\n\nThe agent placed the radio down. His partner in the control room asked, “What’s a Code Sepia?”\n\n“I don’t know. It sounded important so I just let them do whatever. Saves on paperwork.”\n\nThe room then swung wide open. Both agents turned to attention as a woman walked in.\n\n“Deputy Director Shroud, Ma’am!”\n\n“I just got word of a Code Sepia. How are we proceeding?” she asked, subtly staring them down.\n\n“Local forces are moving in to... uh, deal with the target.”\n\nA moment of silence afterwards, she responded, “Good. Keep me apprise of the situation.” She left the room. The agents blew a sign of relief."

    awaits_TREMBLEY.3.d:0 "The two first went to the library to figure out how to decode the document the author left in his journal. As Blubs and Durland searched for them, Dipper was devising how to decode the document. Looking at the triangle, Dipper decided to set it on fire to expose some hidden text, but noticed Mabel had folded it into a hat. As she criticized herself for another silly action, Dipper noticed the folded document now revealed a map and he shrugged at the fact he almost set it on fire instead. Leading to the Gravity Falls Museum of History, they left as Blubs and Durland almost found them.\n\nAt the museum, the two wondered through an exhibition hallway, looking for the next clue.\n\n“The next clue about the real town founder should be right... here!” Dipper turned to a triangular exhibition piece mounted on the wall.\n\nAs Dipper got close to determine what could be the next clue, Mabel quickly grew bored at studying it. She sat down on the bench across from it and then turned upside down to stare at it some more. After demanding it to be “less stupid”, it struck her, “It worked!”\n\nDipper rushed over and sat upside down with her, “Wait! It's not abstract, it's upside-down!”\n\nThe artwork now pointing at the cemetery, they rushed over there. They arrived at a statue pointing elsewhere. Dipper turned to where it was pointing, trying to get an idea what was at that direction. When he turned around, Mabel had climbed up on it and stuck the statue’s finger into her nose.\n\n“Oh, gross! She's picking my nose! Ha ha!” The finger then bent, lodging it further in her nose, “Ach!”\n\nA secret passage opened up in front of the statue. After freeing her nose, the twins descended down into the cavern and after making it through a series of boobytraps, entered a room full of historic artifacts. Reading through the documents, Dipper found what they were after.\n\n“The true founder of Gravity Falls was... Sir Lord Quentin Trembley, III, Esquire.”"

Demanding to know how this secret was a matter of “National Security”, Blubs took out a film reel from under his hat and played it to them.\n\nAn FPI agent of Asian descent appeared, clearly reading off a teleprompt, “If you're watching this, then you are one of eight people in these United States with clearance to view this information. In fact, I myself will be shot as soon as the filming is complete? Oh haha, real funny Hector!” The agent drew a visible circle of light in the air with his finger, followed by the screams of a man catching on fire and the film properly cutting off to the next section, “Of all of America's secrets, the most embarrassing was that of Quentin Trembley: The eighth-and-a-half president of the United States!”\n\nThey watch of all the weird and silly things of President Trembley as the president, such as how he waged war on pancakes, appointed six babies to the supreme court, and issued the Depantsipation Proclamation. It went on to explain how he was run out of office and ended up founding Gravity Falls after plummeting into it at high speeds. After he disappeared, he was then erased from history, replaced with a different ninth president, and an idiot named Nathaniel Northwest was promoted as the official founder of the town. His whereabouts were unknown.\n\n“Until now!” said Sheriff Blubs.\n\nHe pulled off the sheets to unveil Trembley himself, encased in a solid, amber-colored block made of peanut brittle. Thanks to the twins and Mabel leaving a trail straight to them with her butterscotch wrappers, the two have found Trembley’s body.\n\n“Now that you know the truth, well, we can't let you go around talkin' about it,” said Blubs.\n\nDipper asked, “Does that mean...”\n\n“Are you going to kill us?!” shouted Mabel.\n\nDurland panicked, “OH NO!”\n\n“No, no. Calm down now, buddy, calm down. We're just gonna escort you and all this stuff back to Washington...”"

Suddenly, the whole block began to crack, and it all fell apart. From it, Quentin Trembley awoke and emerged from his sleep, the peanut brittle having truly sustained him in all those years.\n\n“It is I, Quentin Trembley!” He then ripped off his pants.\n\nWith the matter still at hand, they worked their way to get out of the wooden box they were stuck in. Trembley and Mabel rushed to try and jump through a hole in box. A woodpecker flew by and began to peck at it and the box promptly fell apart. They rushed out through the train carts, passing by Blubs as he was getting some ice. He and Durland made their pursuit of them, and they ended up on the roof of a train cart. Cornered again, Dipper asked them.\n\n“Sheriff Blubs, do you really want to lock us all up in a government facility somewhere?”\n\n“'I’ve got no choice! Our orders come from the very top!”\n\nDipper then came up with a legal loophole. He asked Trembley if he ever resign. His departure of the white house consisted of him eating a salamander and jumping out of the window. Dipper argued to Sheriff Blubs that means he never vacated his office and was still the President of the Unites States. They doubted for a moment, but when Trembley ordered them to stand down and take a vacation, they were convinced.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBack in town, the town cheered on as Trembley took to the stage. Pacifica didn’t seem to care at all, but her father Preston seemed more apprehensive at the sight of Trembley. Trembley gave his speech of the current state of the country and vowed to save America. He awarded Mabel the title of an official congressman and gave Dipper the Presidential Key that could unlock any door.\n\nSeeing a way to rid of Trembley before he blew their story, Preston urged him to ride to Portland, where the governors of the Western States were meeting to deal with President Curtis. Trembley eagerly agreed and with cheer and fanfare, he mounted a horse backward and rode off over a nearby cliff and into the sunset.\n\nAs the day ended, Stan having fallen asleep in the stockades, Dipper noticed as the Northwest were quickly leaving the scene. Dipper rushed over with the document of Nathanial Northwest and shoved it through the open window to Pacifica as their limousine drove off. Dipper smiled as he heard Pacifica’s reaction."

Then jumped onto a horse and rode off towards the sunset,” said Mabel.\n\n“And also off a cliff,” added Dipper.\n\n“Yo dudes, that’s a cool story...” An idea struck Soos, “But I gotta bounce. I need to go make another “Fixin it with Soos” and do all of the graphics and editing for it to make it look sick.”\n\n“Cool. Bye Soos,” the twins said before high fiving him. They left to continue on their adventure, as Soos began to devise his next big idea.\n\nSoos went into his improvised workshop room, ignoring the clock Stan “accidently” broke. Too focused on the story the twins said, he came up with an idea and quickly began building a contraption with a peanut extractor and several other candy making contractions, all while filming it.\n\nHe turned to the camera, “And that is how you build a one way time machine!” \n\nHe turned off the recording and quickly edited the graphics in and posted it, before laying in the machine and letting himself be consumed by the liquid peanut brittle. He stuck a straw in his mouth, figuring he would still need to breathe anyway. As the twins got back, bruised up from their radical encounter with the abominable snow-bro, they looked around."

What you have in mind?”\n\n“How about we wake him up and make him think he’s in the future?”\n\nDipper stroked his chin, “Hmm, what does Soos think is in the future?”\n\n“Alien lizard people with frog skin? Oh, maybe robots with lazer eyes? We still have some leftover costume accessories from Summer-ween. I’ll start making them!”\n\nAs Mabel worked on that, making their costumes and “future-fying” the living room, Dipper device on how to wake Soos up. The brittle already frozen, and much thicker than Trembley’s, he placed a few heat lamps next to the tub to defrost him. Next he helped Mable furnish the ‘lab’ he’ll be in, using an elaborate trap to catch Wax Larry King’s head and shove it in a jar for that cartoon show of the future Soos liked. Once that was all set, Mabel brought in their costumes and set up the speaker to play ‘The Fox’.\n\nDipper quickly turned it off, “Pretty sure they have better music in the future.”\n\n“Such a killjoy.

    mabel_magnet.2.d:0 ""In today's Guide, I will show you how to apologize to your great uncle! For today's example, I will apologize to Grunkle Stan for causing heavy retinal damage!"\n\nShe walked into the living room as Stan sat in his chair. His bandages still wrapped his eyes tightly as he listened to the TV. He murmured all the while. \n\n"Stupid color. Don't even like colors or rainbows."\n\n"Hey Grunkle Stan!"\n\nStan panicked for a moment, turned his head to figure out where Mabel was, "Oh no. You stay away from me, Mabel!"\n\nMabel laughed and slapped his knee, causing him to jerk, "Come on Grunkle Stan. You don't mean that."\n\nHe sat forward and turned to stare at her. She was standing on the opposite side from where he was looking at, "I do."\n\n"Okay, look," she pouted her face and poked her cheek dimples, opening her eyes wide with a deep frown, "I'm so sorry!"\n\n"Mabel, your sad face won't work."\n\n"How so?" She asked. He waved his hand in front of his face. She snapped her fingers, realizing it, "Oh right. Can't see it."\n\n"Just leave me alone, Mabel," Stan sank into his seat, "I'm just going to contemplate how I'm gonna die sad and alone... well, more than usual anyway."\n\nMabel proclaimed, "Don't worry Grunkle Stan. I'll make it up to you!""
    mabel_magnet.2.a:0 ""What does Stan almost love as much as me? Hmmm... Money!""
    mabel_magnet.2.b:0 ""Time to turn the frown upside down with a makeover!""

    mabel_magnet.3.d:0 "Dipper walked in as Candy and Greta filmed Mabel in the kitchen.\n\n"Uh. What are you doing?" Asked Dipper.\n\nCandy replied, "Mabel is going to use her suit of magnets to steal coins from unsuspecting tourists."\n\n"She's going to use science to rob them clean. It's gonna be awesome!" Said Greta.\n\nDipper turned to see Mabel in a magnet themed sweater while wearing a series of horseshoe magnets attached to her, pointing in every direction. The magnets all have a wire connected to them, ready to send a charge and actually create a magnetic field. She picked up two more and turned to the camera.\n\n“Hey there everyone! Today I have a special two-for-one guide special where we learn of the wonder of magnets... and use it to make a quick buck! What no better way to make it up to your con-artist of a great uncle!”\n\nCandy and Greta nodded to each other, “Genius!”\n\nDipper interrupted, "Uh, Mabel. I really don't think you should do this. This doesn't look safe… like at all."\n\n"Relax Dipper. I got this. It's my guide to life, afterall."\n\n"You sorta have to be alive for a guide, Mabel,” Dipper noticed and quickly grabbed a rather ornate set of Stan’s kitchen knives and shoved them into a cabinet, “I really wouldn't turn those magnets on.""
    mabel_magnet.3.a:0 ""Fine Dipper. Such a killjoy...""
    mabel_magnet.3.b:0 ""It'll be fine. I'm just going to get some change...""

    mabel_magnet.4.d:0 "“Alright Candy. Hit It!”\n\nCandy grabbed the two ends of the power cables, “Engaging magnetic energy field.”\n\nWith a spark of the plugs, the magnets went live. Mabel held her hands out with the magnets, as the metal objects in the kitchen began to shake. A spoon then flung into the air off the counter and attached to one of the magnets. Dipper began to step back in fright as Candy and Greta looked on in awe. Another utensil flew at her and stuck to another magnet on her body. Then far more in quick possession.\n\nDipper noticed the cabinet he shoved the knives in and he rushed to close it. But then the large metal objects began to slowly move from their palace. The fridge shifted a few inches. The stove was pulled out from its exhaust pipe and the sink's faucet burst and sprayed water all over.\n\nStan walked in, singing a tune to himself, “Money, money. Love me some money. Hey kids, what are you doing?”\n\n“I got you a gift, Grunkle Stan. A-”\n\nThe microwave suddenly flew by Stan."

    mabel_magnet.5.t:0 "Medical Bill"
    mabel_magnet.5.d:0 "Stan, Dipper, Greta and Candy sat in the lobby of the local medical clinic. All of them awaited to hear of what happened to Mabel. FInally, the doors swung open and the doctor and Mabel walked out.\n\n“Mabel!”\n\nThey rushed over to the doctor. He spoke, “Young Mabel here will be fine. Her braces took the blunt of the hit. She has remarkably strong equipment in her mouth.”\n\n“Dad said they had to take her to three different specialists just to get those braces on her,” said Dipper, “All of them say that given her eating habits, she’ll have them on until she's an adult.”\n\n“Seesh, Gene spoils you. When your grandpa Shermie had a toothache, our dad just ripped it out and told him to walk it off like a man.”\n\nMabel slowly tiled back and forth, her eyes slowly closing and opening, “Hehehe, walk it off... walk it off.”\n\nThe doctor continued, “She is still delirious from all the medication we gave her. Taking a full size microwave to the face can be... painful.”\n\n“Woah...” Mabel quickly looked around her, “Do you see all the painbows?”\n\n“Painbow?”\n\n“Uh, it must be the drugs,” said Stan. He dismissed her ramble and turned to the doctor, “So, the bill?”\n\n“Oh yes, so normally we would take her insurance. But as Oregon is now in a standoff with California, we can’t file a claim, so...”"
    mabel_magnet.5.a:0 "“Ugh, what’s the cost?”"
    
    mabel_magnet.6.t:0 "Blind Eye of the Tiger"
    mabel_magnet.6.d:0 "Stan stood in front of the bathroom mirror. He grabbed the ends of the bandages behind his head and slowly began to unwrap the bandages around his eyes. He dropped them into the sink and slowly reopened his eyes. Still fogged up, he leaned in and stared at himself.\n\n“Everything seems to be there. Wrinkles, gray hair, cataracts...” He pulled away and rubbed his eyes before looking at himself in the mirror once more, “Need no quack doctor to fix my eyes. I can see just fine.”\n\nSuddenly, the curtains of the shower tub swung open. Inside were the girls, holding up make-up equipment. Stan leaned in closer to their reflection in the mirror.\n\n“What is that, a woodpecker?”\n\n“Get him, girls!” yelled Mabel.\n\nThe girls jumped him and dragged him down.\n\nStan yelled out, “Ah, what's happening?”\n\n“Beauty’s happening!”\n\n“Girls, no!”\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA half an hour later, Mabel finished putting on the final touches on Stan’s face. She placed the paintbrush down and gestured Candy to zoom in on Stan’s face with the video camera. Great held a mirror up to Stan.\n\nStan took a moment to check his new image. Then turned to Mabel.\n\n“I’d be pretty mad at you girls...” He took another look at the mirror and the tiger face painting he had, “If I didn’t look so fantastic!”\n\n“Success! Well Grunkle Stan?”\n\n“Alright Mabel. I forgive you. I can’t stay mad at you anyway... Hmm, Mr. Mystery Tiger,” he kept checking himself out in the mirror, “That’ll go well in the next mystery tour.”\n\n“Thanks Grunkle Stan,” she pointed out the door, “Take it to the streets, girls!”\n\nAs they departed, Greta grabbed the bottle of aftershave in Stan’s hand, “I’m taking your aftershade!”\n\nStan wondered who was next as they left."
    mabel_magnet.6.a:0 "“Good luck to that next poor sap. Time to cash this face in for some money!”"
