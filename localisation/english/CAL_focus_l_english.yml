 CAL_domestic.1:0 "Ensure Progress"
 CAL_domestic.1_desc:0 "For a man of the 19th Century, and even today really, Joshua Norton is viewed by many as a progressive man, with talks of equal rights and the fair treatment of one another. We can use this to keep California's Progressives in line with us."

 CAL_domestic.2:0 "Uphold Tradition"
 CAL_domestic.2_desc:0 "The 20th Century saw America replace the old world as the new global empire. Even fractured, the EU and IC won't dare attack us. With Norton's return, America finally has her new Emperor, and we can use this to keep the Traditionalist on our side."

 CAL_domestic.3:0 "Implement UBI"
 CAL_domestic.3_desc:0 "The fall of the US placed many of our most vulnerable populace without the means to support ourselves and our current system can barely help them. With a catch-all system like Universal Basic Income, we can support them and boost the economy... in the long run."
 CAL_domestic.3.t:0 "This §CRadical Solution§! will greatly improve Emperor Norton's approval among the Progressive IDR and decrease the rate of support decay every polling session. However, the Traditionalist IDR will strongly disapprove this, and their support decay will increase unless we satisfy them with something on their agenda."
 
 CAL_domestic.4:0 "Uphold Social Security"
 CAL_domestic.4_desc:0 "The federal Government and its systems are gone, but many people still depend on its expansive social nets. California has the infrastructure and resource to take over the old Federal system and doing so can help with our legitimacy in restoring the US."
 CAL_domestic.4.t:0 "A §8Moderate Solution§!. This Act will still have some support from the Progressive IDR Support as well as from the Moderate NDR. Reaction from the Traditionalist will be minor, but this won’t placate Progressives if we had supported a major Traditionalist Agenda. "
 
 CAL_domestic.5:0 "Aid Small Businesses"
 CAL_domestic.5_desc:0 "As our own nation, its time we put our title as the fifth largest GDP in the world, behind the US, the EU, the IC, and SEATO, to the test. And to do so, we must start from the bottom and support our small businesses. The Mom-and-Pop Shop of today is the Mega-Corp of tomorrow!"
 CAL_domestic.5.t:0 "A §8Moderate Solution§!. This Act will still have some support from the Traditionalist IDR Support as well as from the Moderate NDR. Reaction from the Progressives will be minor, but this won’t placate Traditionalist if we had supported a major Progressive Agenda. "
 
 CAL_domestic.6:0 "Remove Regulations and Restrictions"
 CAL_domestic.6_desc:0 "California still enforcing such bothersome regulations and restrictions, preventing the market from expanding with the US gone. We must be competitive in what still remains of the global market (Which is mostly South America at this point)! Its time to make the Market Free."
 CAL_domestic.6.t:0 "This §RReactionary Solution§! will greatly improve Emperor Norton's approval among the Traditionalist IDR and decrease the rate of support decay every polling session. However, the Progressive IDR will strongly disapprove this, and their support decay will increase unless we satisfy them with something on their agenda."
 
 CAL_domestic.7:0 "Pass Norton Care"
 CAL_domestic.7_desc:0 "We can't have people dying from simply diseases because the doctor was too expensive. It was embarrassing when the US let it happen and more so for California. Damn the cost, we need ensure healthcare for all!\nThe Emperor will see to it!"
 CAL_domestic.7.t:0 "Grant +§G20§! Support from the §CProgressive Branch§! of the IDR.\nPeople dropping dead is also expensive. We'll write Norton Care off as a long term investment."
 
 CAL_domestic.8:0 "New Tax Codes"
 CAL_domestic.8_desc:0 "California Tax Code and Collection System is as archaic as the old Federal Government. And the rates keep going up with little to show for it. The Emperor will not rob his citizens. By having a full revamp of the tax code from fund allocation to collection, we can lower taxes for most Californians and ensure our funding is stable and well spent."
 CAL_domestic.8.t:0 "Grant +§G20§! Support from the §RTraditionalist Branch§! of the IDR.\nWe’re still taxing Birnbaum and the rich through the nose though. Just easier now with less paperwork."
 
 CAL_domestic.9:0 "Change Assembley Procedures"
 CAL_domestic.9_desc:0 "These major, wide changing bills being introduced by the two blocs of the Northern IDR is making appeasing both sides difficult. But by altering the Assembly Rules on Bill Introduction, we can force the break down of these large bills into smaller ones. Not only would some bills get approval from both sides, but the Moderate NDRs are more likely to support the bill in general."
 CAL_domestic.9.t:0 "Grant +§G25§! Support from the §8Moderate NDR§!.\nThis will unlock §Yadditional decisions§! to gaining support between the three political blocs."

 CAL_division.2:0 "Tour Southern California"
 CAL_division.2_desc:0 "While Northern California swept Norton into office, Southern California had far less enthusiasm for him and are themselves divided about him. A tour of the south can help start a campaign of unification and trust building between Norton and the South."
 CAL_division.2.t:0 "Grant +§G20§! Support from §GSouthern California.§!"
 
 CAL_division.3:0 "Diversify the Cabinet"
 CAL_division.3_desc:0 "Lumeta has been running around finding politicians to fill Norton's cabinet. Along with clear choices like US Senator Everett as Secretary of State, we can look to Lt. Governor Diaz-Guzman and the south to diversify the cabinet and ensure a balance of political power between the north and south."
 CAL_division.3.t:0 "Grant +§G20§! Support from §GSouthern California§! and the §8Moderate NDR§!.\nGiving them meaningless titles like “Lord” and “Lady” will also help make them invested in Norton's Administration."
 
 CAL_division.4:0 "Strengthen The Imperial Congress"
 CAL_division.4_desc:0 "A new congress has been assembled between California align states. But the old system of using our old federal representatives mean we outnumber everyone else combine. Redividing representatives within the Imperial House and empowering the Imperial Senate will aid our legitimacy and ensure the other states stand with us."
 CAL_division.4.t:0 "Being the Senate is for losers, anyway."
 
 CAL_division.5:0 "Strengthen The Imperial Governor"
 CAL_division.5_desc:0 "It’s becoming abundantly clear that the new congress has no idea how to run a rival government to the eastern US. Even the one in Oregon is more competent than ours. With a loyal and competent cabinet court, its time the Emperor takes direct control of the matters at hand."
 CAL_division.5.t:0 "Norton is the House and the Senate! I like to see someone else be as bicameral as him... the Lieutenant Governor doesn't count."
 
 CAL_division.6:0 "The Question of Bakersfieldville"
 CAL_division.6_desc:0 "To distract the populace from more critical issues, someone in the State Assembly brought up the city of Bakersfieldville in the Central Valley. This ended badly as Northern and Southern Assembly Members broke into fierce arguing about which part of the state the city is considered part of. No one wanted the sad, depressing place to be part of their half of the state and now Norton must address it."
 CAL_division.6.t:0 "Oh dear God, why did someone even mention that place?\nGrant -§R10§! Support from §1All Factions§! in California."
 
 CAL_division.7:0 "One Government"
 CAL_division.7_desc:0 "With the new Imperial Congress established, we now stand ready to assert ourselves as a legitimate continuation of the American government. Let the world know that our imperial republic shall spread the glory of Norton from sea to shining sea."
 CAL_division.7.t:0 ""
 
 CAL_division.8:0 "One California"
 CAL_division.8_desc:0 "California has endured so much since the beginning of the Long Summer. As the rest of the world burned metaphorically (in our case, literally), our state has arisen from the Kerfuffle stronger and more united. Only time itself will tell how we shall fare going forward."
