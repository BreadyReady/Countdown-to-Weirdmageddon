 ROADKILL_NAME:0 "West of Weird"
 ROADKILL_DESC:0 "The summer approches! The sun shines hot and only the cool green hills of Cascadia can bring relief. Out in the Oregon Outback, just west of Weird, something is amiss in that sleeply town of Gravity Falls and everywhere around it. One things for certain.\n\nThis summer will most certainly be an eventful one."
 HITTING_FAN_NAME:0 "The Hitting of the Fan"
 HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "Yup, that's right! That umbrella collection is about to come in real handy."
 MYS_ROADKILL_DESC:0 "The World-Famous Mystery Shack has been a staple of Gravity Falls for thirty years. At the helm is the famed Man of Mystery, Stanford Pines! Whether you are out enjoying the Oregon Outback, or visiitng the ever sleepy town of Gravity Falls, come by the Mystery Shack to see what secrets and wonders await!\n\nAnd yet, in all this time, nearly no one had suspect what true mysteries lurk beneath this tourist trap. Truely this "Stan" Pines is the Man of Mystery, a past shrouded by time and deed. But for him, there is no doubt. No matter the obstacle he will face, he is set to achive his goals."
 GTF_ROADKILL_DESC:0 "<NOT DEVELOPED>\n\nFar in the cascadia of Oregon, there is the sleepy and unassuming town of Gravity Falls. For the folks that live there, life is easy and simple. But what most don't know is that they live in an episcenter of unusual and outerworldly phenomenons. True mysteries beyond its tourist attractions lay hidden all around the town and Roadkill County. Who knows what this town has in store for itself and world?"
 NRW_ROADKILL_DESC:0 "<NOT DEVELOPED>\n\nHome of the private estate of the Northwest Family, the Northwest are one of the richest families on Earth. Their business extend into nearly every sector of the American Economy and they themesleves are held in high regard in the town their ancestor founded.\nBut in the modern day, as secrets from the past surface, the family legacy and all the turth in it is about to catch up to them. Time will tell if they maintain apperences, find redemption for past sin, or if the company that bares their name decides new leadership is in order."
 MYM_ROADKILL_DESC:0 "<NOT DEVELOPED>\n\nLocated in the hills overlooking Ochoco National Forest, the Mystery Mountain is a favored tourist spot in the outback of Oregon. Unbeknownst to most, it is also the last refuge of the Arachnimorphs, a race of shape shifting spiders.\n\nOnce having infiltrated the high seats of government, a mix of Anti-Arachnid operations by the FPI and a coup by the Lizard People has driven them back to a tiny part of Oregon. But with Darlene, they bide their time to return."
 GNM_ROADKILL_DESC:0 "<NOT DEVELOPED>\n\nThe Death of the Gnome Kingdom’s Queen has brought the gnomes to the brink of collapse. The forest they once ruled is divided and they themselves coward away at the small heart of their lands. Under the Regent Jeff Little-Legs, times have not improved and blame is flying about.\n\nNow, Jeff must strike deep and restore the kingdom. Whether that be finding their new queen, or taking total power for himself, the gnomes shall rise again!"
 UFC_ROADKILL_DESC:0 "<NOT DEVELOPED>\n\nBorn from the chaos following the Gnome Kingdom’s collapse, the United Forest was born from a mix of common goals, common enemy, and common rivalry. The Multi-Bears lead the new forest nation, while the Unicorns flex their way into power to not be outdone. \n\nWith many internal and external issues about, time will tell if this union of circumstance shall last."
 MAN_ROADKILL_DESC:0 "<NOT DEVELOPED>\n\nUnder the wise and apparently feared rule of the Gnome Queen, the Manotaurs were the great warriors of the kingdom and accounted for most of the forest’s testosterone. Without the queen however, they had struck out on their own and quickly waged war against their ‘sissy’ enemy, the multi-bears, only to lose.\n\nLicking wounds and buffing up, the Manotaurs won’t back down just yet."
 OTHER_ROADKILL_DESC:0 "Worlds are on the verge of collision. From the weirdness, new normals shall arise. New adventures to be have, new plans to bring to fruition. The quest for Chaos or Order, domination or something even greater. Across the multiverse, people will fight for normalacy. Some, however, shall fight to bring about wierdmageddon!"

 WILD_WEST_NAME:0 "The Long Summer <Not Developed>"
 WILD_WEST_DESC:0 "President Curtis once said that America is basically the whole world. One only needs to see the United States to see that the whole world is heading towards disaster. Something great hovers above them from Sea to Shining Sea, while new dangers across the multiverse begin their final approach towards Earth. Without a doubt, its going to be a very Long Summer.\n\nAnd they say Earth is "Mostly Harmless"?"
 ORE_WILD_WEST_DESC:0 "<NOT DEVELOPED>\n\nThe Heart of Cascadia. Oregon is the core center of the West, where many once traveled the route that bore its name heading to it. From the forest filled lands of the outback to the cities and farmlands of the Willamette Valley, Oregon is a state both new and old, rural and city, forward in progression yet rooted in tradition.\n\nA bit odd and weird, but that never stopped it."
 CAL_WILD_WEST_DESC:0 "<NOT DEVELOPED>\n\nThe embodiment of the West, California is in many ways its own nation. Its vast lands are as varied as the rest of the US; with farms that feed millions, mountains that touch the sky, coastlines to the grand Pacific, and cities that are home to millions more.\n\nLeading the US in technology and economic output, the will of the Californians influence all, whether or not that’s desired by others."
 WAS_WILD_WEST_DESC:0 "<NOT DEVELOPED>\n\nThe land of Columbia, the State of Washington bears the name of the founder of America with pride. Nestled between it odd brother to the south and it powerful yet quirky cousin to the north, Washington is a state that stays Evergreen through winter or summer, and whatever event befalls it.\n\nNo matter what comes, Columbia shall roll on!"
 EUS_WILD_WEST_DESC:0 "<NOT DEVELOPED>\n\nTruely the center of the world, if not the multiverse, the United States is a nation on the cusp of something grand. A true, if surprising, statement for a country that is also on the verge of self destruction. It's President is hated, its people are restless, and everyone is gunning for them. Time will tell if the 75-Star Union can stand up againts what threat comes next. The same goes for what would dare stand againts America as well..."
 EPI_WILD_WEST_DESC:0 "<NOT DEVELOPED>\nBorn from the paranormal events of the early days of the amercian colonies, the Federal Paranormal Investigation is humanity's secret shield againts what horror awaits beyond their dimension. Once upon a time, their finest agents battle dangers across the world and the multiverse, from zombie outbreaks in the trenches of western europe and Himmler's Aryan Super Chickens, to clandestine operations in other worlds that would make the junior agency known as the CIA blush. Now though, the FPI isn't what it once. But with what dangers still await at home and abroad, it will have to face what it had sowed since its creation."
 CAN_WILD_WEST_DESC:0 "<NOT DEVELOPED>\n\nThe Heart of the Imperial Commonwealth. Canada has arisin as the guardian of peace in a world that always teetered near destruction. From the days of the Cold War to the bulwark of peace between the Yanks and the Euros, even as an afterthought, most know that the leader of the Commonwealth keeps the world safe by mere presence. For a better world, she is the lynchpin of diplomacy. One can only image what the world would fall to if that lynchpin is removed."
 MEX_WILD_WEST_DESC:0 "<NOT DEVELOPED>\n\nKnown by many as America’s great southern neighbor, Mexico has emerged from the turmoil of the 20th century stronger then ever before. With the superpowers of the world vying to bring it into their influence, Mexico had leverage its new position to further strengthen it.\n\nBut with new challenges abound, many fear Mexico's good fortune is about to come to a sudden and painful end."
 OTHER_WILD_WEST_DESC:0 "Worlds are on the verge of collision. From the weirdness, new normals shall arise. New adventures to be have, new plans to bring to fruition. The quest for Chaos or Order, domination or something even greater. Across the multiverse, people will fight for normalacy. Some, however, shall fight to bring about wierdmageddon!"

 ANOTHER_DIMENSION_NAME:0 "Sunset on Mewni"
 ANOTHER_DIMENSION_DESC:0 "For the last 300 years, the Mewman people have experienced an unprecedented period of peace. Although some conflicts have erupted, nothing has disrupted the daily lives of the Mewman people ever since the Solairan conquests.\n\nYet."
 MEW_ANOTHER_DIMENSION_DESC:0 "The Mewman Hegemony is starting to crack. Economic dependance on corn, no incentives to industrialize, and an illiterate populace have held Mewni back centuries compared to other dimensions. And with monsters in the north and south consolidating their power, it is only a matter of time when the Kingdom will finally go through another great test. And if it is to fail... the entire dimension will be dragged down with it."
 LUD_ANOTHER_DIMENSION_DESC:0 "Ludo Avarius has a dream to take the Butterfly Magic Wand. [Disclaimer: Content only appears later in game]"
 JOH_ANOTHER_DIMENSION_DESC:0 "C"
 LUC_ANOTHER_DIMENSION_DESC:0 "C"
 PNY_ANOTHER_DIMENSION_DESC:0 "C"
 SPI_ANOTHER_DIMENSION_DESC:0 "C"
 PIG_ANOTHER_DIMENSION_DESC:0 "C"
 TSR_ANOTHER_DIMENSION_DESC:0 "The Tsarstvo Monstrov, or Tsardom of Monsters, is one of the oldest surviving monster nations on record. This is attributed to their irrelevance: since their Kingdom is so poor and backwards (even by pre-industrial standards) it has seen almost no conquerors in it's over a thousand year long history, because a war for this land wouldnt be worth it. This still rings through today.\n\nToday, the Tsardom stands on wobbly legs as it always has. But the current Tsar is diffrent. Will his adherence to Mewman philosophies save the Tsardom and drag it out of poverty? Or will he be the last straw?"
 SWP_ANOTHER_DIMENSION_DESC:0 "The Coalition of the Swamp is the most stable place in the Forest of Certain Death and is, arguably, the best place to live. The various villages operate autonomously, resulting in little internal conflict. And trade has been opened up to the Mewmans to the east, resulting in higher than average prosperity.\n\nHowever, there are some rising ideologies taking grassroots in the nation. Although the ideologies of Communism, Democracy, and Militarism see no extremists within the Coalition, it is only a matter of time until they do."
 DTH_ANOTHER_DIMENSION_DESC:0 "Situated in the very center of the Forest of Certain Death, the CFCD is both blessed and cursed by geography. But Eugene Alisach chose this location to be isolated from other warlords, and thus he could foster and grow the number of his "philisophical followers" without outside interference.\n\nHe intended to form a unified canon based on the many various myths of the Forest and it's people. However, he seems unenthusiastic and it's obvious that he will give up the reins of power soon. The question is, who will be his succsesor?"
 AVA_ANOTHER_DIMENSION_DESC:0 "Robbed by son and Mewman alike, the fallen King Brudo Avarius nears his return to power."
 HGH_ANOTHER_DIMENSION_DESC:0 "Forest High School is a state which did not intend to be a state. It started out as a normal highschool, but as turmoil churned around it the downtrodden started to see it as a beacon of hope. They started donating, volunteering as guards, even giving up land.\n\nUnder the watchful eye of Principal Terhalis, the school and it's lands have become a bastion of stability. Although the kids get a bit rowdy, as long as the adults aren't going anywhere the school will prosper for years to come!\n\n...the adults will stay, right?"
 MHC_ANOTHER_DIMENSION_DESC:0 "Formed out of lands from of the Johansen and Jaggy Kingdoms, the Mewman Occupation is not a nation in the convetional sense. It is a "temporary" administrative state, and once this state accomplishes it's goals, it will be dissolved and it's lands distributed back to their previous owners.\n\nHowever, Occupation General Jenny Cosmia has bigger ambitions. She hungrily looks to the west, and is ready to carve an independant state of her own in a neo-Solarian conquest. Her higher ups would never allow it, but the second that Mewni goes through some major turmoil..."
 OTHER_ANOTHER_DIMENSION_DESC:0 "Worlds are on the verge of collision. From the weirdness, new normals shall arise. New adventures to be have, new plans to bring to fruition. The quest for Chaos or Order, domination or something even greater. Across the multiverse, people will fight for normalacy. Some, however, shall fight to bring about wierdmageddon!"
