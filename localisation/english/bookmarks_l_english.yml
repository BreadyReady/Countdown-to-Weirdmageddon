 WILD_WEST_NAME:0 "The Long Summer <Not Developed>"
 WILD_WEST_DESC:0 "President Curtis once said that America is basically the whole world. One only needs to see the United States to see that the whole world is heading towards disaster.

 WAS_WILD_WEST_DESC:0 "<NOT DEVELOPED>\n\n"
 EUS_WILD_WEST_DESC:0 "<NOT DEVELOPED>\n\nTruely the center of the world, if not the multiverse, the United States is a nation on the cusp of something grand. A true, if surprising, statement for a country that is also on the verge of self destruction. It's President is hated, its people are restless, and everyone is gunning for them.

From the days of the Cold War to the bulwark of peace between the Yanks and the Euros, even as an afterthought, most know that the leader of the Commonwealth keeps the world safe by mere presence.

 MEW_ANOTHER_DIMENSION_DESC:0 "The Mewman Hegemony is starting to crack. Economic dependance on corn, no incentives to industrialize, and an illiterate populace have held Mewni back centuries compared to other dimensions.
