 CAL_JANNA.1.t:0 "Internship"
 CAL_JANNA.1.d:0 "Hector Diaz-Guzman. Lieutenant Governor of California. A fit yet aging man, the man sat in his chair, staring up at the ceiling and contemplating his life at this moment. He opened his drawer and pulled out a solid metal forearm bracelet. It was adorned with unique engravings of his hispanic roots and the center was a crystal star that radiated a low power resonance. Hector thought of the old life he had and all that had lead up to today. It was then there was a knock on his office door. His secretary was already gone for the day, so he went over to personally open the door to see who it was.\n\n"Sup, DeeGee." Said Janna.\n\nAfter a moment, he recognized her, "Oh hey, you're that kid that torments Marco. What are you doing in Sac-Town?"\n\n"My Parents said to get a summer job and word is you need an aid. Of the subversion sort of task, political brokering, cooresion, investigating. That kind of stuff."\n\n"And a 15 year old girl can do the job of a political strongman?"\n\nJanna chuckled, "You underestimate me. A sample of my work," She handed him a folder, "He doesn't even know."\n\nHector read through the folder, "So you have my grandnephew's SSN and detailed information... oh, so that's his middle name. This is both criminal and not really hard to get, Janna. Just go back to Echo Creek and don't  open a line of credit under Marco's name."\n\nShe seemingly gave up quickly and shrugged her shoulders, "Oh well. If that's what you want. Former Deputy Director Hector Daiz of the Federal Paranormal Investigations!"\n\nHector pulled her into his office and slammed the door. He pulled out his .223 pistol instinctually before reholstering it as it was just a teenage girl. Janna all the while smiled at Hector's provocation. "How do you know that?"\n\n"Better you put my skills to work digging into other people's history than your own. Wouldn't you say?"\n\nHector looked at her straight, "I can have you extracted and unpersoned, Janna Ordonia."\n\nShe matched his glance and pulled out a food container from her backpack, "I brought Lumpia."\n\n"Done!" He grabbed the container and began eating the lumpia, "I'll have you placed on some internship. Come back tomorrow morning and we'll start your training."\n\n"Nice""
 CAL_JANNA.1.a:0 ""Do I get a gun like yours also?""
 
 
 
 
 
 
 CAL_JANNA.11.t:0 "The Manna Heresy"
 CAL_JANNA.11.d:0 "Through the busy streets of Port Festiva, Star, Marco, and Janna made their way to the Californian Embassy. Passing through the gates and into the building, they walked up to the office of the Imperial Bureau of Investigations. They walked in to be greeted by Marco’s Uncle, Californian Lieutenant Governor Hector Diaz-Guzman. “Oh good, you three are here. Janne, we need to talk,” He said as they all sat down.\n\n“Is this about those Jaggy Royal Court hostages?”\n\n“What hostages? Uhg, never mind that," Hector handed her a folder, “Word from the Forest of Certain Death is that a Death Cult has emerged. And Apparently they worship you as their leader!”\n\nJanna smiled, “That? Oh yeah, I needed a safe house and they offered to accommodate me,” she turned to Marco, “I got a real silver tongue here.”\n\nHe crossed his arms and grumbled, “Still want my $650 back from that Ponzi scheme...”\n\n“Is that bad?” asked Star.\n\n“Heh, probably not,” Hector handed Janna another file, “But I got new intel on them. Her role has escalated to borderline deity. And with that comes some odd shippings by them.”\n\nJanna took look, “There’s a sect called the “Order of Janstar?”\n\n“What?” Star took the file, “They’re shipping you and me?! We got to stop them.”\n\nJanne took the file back and placed her arm around Star, getting very close to her, “Hold on, this could be interesting. We can use this to our advantage.”\n\nHector coughed, “There is also another, uh, competing sect,” He handed her another file.\n\n“Oh, I wonder what that could... The Manna Brotherhood? Oh, ew, no! Not me and Marco.”\n\n“Haha!” laughed Marco.\n\nShe stood up walked to the fireplace and punched a brick. The wall above opened up and a rack of firearms came out. She grabbed a P90 and tossed a Berett .50 Cal to Marco, who was promptly pinned to the ground by its weight. “Star, open a portal. Time to purge some heretics for the Emperor.”\n\nHector walked over in mild annoyance and grabbed the P90, “No Janna. These sects come and go. I won’t authorized use of force.” He placed the weapons back, “Just be careful next time who you interact with. Now go be platonic with each other somewhere else.”"
 CAL_JANNA.11.a:0 "“Not Cool, DeeGee. Not Cool At All.”"

 CAL_GUSTAV.1.t:0 "The Gustav Kerfuffle"
 CAL_GUSTAV.1.d:0 "On a quiet morning, the doorbell rang at the Diaz Residence.\n\n“I’ll get it!” yelled Star from upstairs.\n\nDownstairs in the kitchen, Marco walked over to the stairs, “Don’t worry Star. I can get it- Ah!”\n\nStar slid down the stair railing, banking a hard left and slamming into Marco. As he laid on the ground, Star stuck the landing and walked over to the front door. “Like I said. I got it!” She opened the door. “Hello...” Her enthusiasm dropped suddenly.\n\n“Hello Star! My fellow exchange student from the land of Mewni!”\n\n“G-Gustav?”\n\nMarco quickly got back up when he heard that name and rushed over to the door, shoving Star aside, “Gustav!”\n\n“Marco, my American friend! How good it is to see you,” they exchanged their long secret handshake as Rafael and Angie rushed over, “Mr and Mrs. Diaz. It is so wonderful to see you, ja?”\n\n“Gustav!”\n\nAs the four of them walked into the living room, conversing about, Star stared at Gustav with distrust."
 CAL_GUSTAV.1.a:0 "“Gustav...”"
 
 CAL_GUSTAV.2.t:0 "Permanent Exchange Student"
 CAL_GUSTAV.2.d:0 "“And there I was, swimming across the Atlantic with a baby seal on my back. I crossed the finish line, set a new world record as fastest swimmer across the Atlantic and reunited that seal with its mother,” he began to shed a tear, Star rolling her eyes, “That was when I heard my beloved homeland of Scandinavia was swept away by the Kerfuffle. The EU Ambassador told me I was the last Scandinavian left on Earth...” He paused as everyone but Star at the dinner table looked on in sadness. He continued, “So I traveled here, to my favorite American Family. I couldn’t even return to Europe. What with, as the Franco-Germans call it, the Third Weltkrieg about to occur and all.”\n\n“You’re safe here with us, Gustav. Mi Casa es Su Casa!” said Rafael.\n\n“And you can rest assured, Gustav,” said Marco’s granduncle Hector as he shoved another meatball into his mouth, “Until the end of the Canadian and Scandinavian Kerfuffle, you are welcome here in the great state of California.”\n\n“Si!” Rafael ate another meatball.\n\n“Oh Diazs, your hospitality warms my cold scandinavian heart!”\n\nStar scoffed at his comment as she poked her meatball, “Yeah, scandinavian...”\n\nHector finished his plate, “I’m going to grab some fresh air. Rafael.”\n\n“Tio Hector.”\n\nThe Lieutenant Governor walked out the back door and leaned against the wall. He took out an e-cigarette and took a puff before taking out his phone. “Now, let’s see what's the status of Project Golden-”"
 CAL_GUSTAV.2.a:0 "Hector!" 
 
 CAL_GUSTAV.3.t:0 "A Smoke and Meatballs"
 CAL_GUSTAV.3.d:0 "Hector dropped his phone and cigarette and scrambled to pick it up. He turned to see Star outside with him. “Star, you startled me. Was there something you needed?”\n\n“You used to be a secret spy, right?”\n\n“What I did is classified. You can't prove anything.”\n\n“What? No, I don't care about that. It's about Gustav. I know something Marco and his parents don’t know.”\n\nHector sighed in relief, “Oh that. You realized the twerp isn’t from Scandinavia?”\n\nStar looked at him in bewilderment, “You knew?”\n\n“I don’t need to be a spy to know that. The kid has Bakersfieldville written over him the moment I met him,” he took another puff, “But dang, doesn’t he make a mean meatball? Besides, he’s harmless.”\n\n“But Marco and Mr. and Mrs. Diaz?”\n\n“Rafael and Angie are not... the most observant people. For Marco, I am a bit disappointed in him for not seeing through the Gustav shtick. His grandfather Jaun had a keen eye.”\n\nMarco walked out the door with the trash, “What are you two talking about?”\n\nHector suddenly panicked, “Huh, just diplomatic stuff. Corn trades with Mewni and all.”\n\nStar turned to Hector, “Yeah, uh... Would You Be Interested In A Trade Agreement With Mewni?”\n\nMarco shrugged, tossed the trash and walked back inside. Hector turned to Star, “Leave it alone, Star. If there's one thing Californians can agree on, besides those dang Texans, is that acknowledging Bakersfieldville only leads to trouble...” As he went back inside, he noticed Star’s wand and the split star on it, “Is your wand okay?”\n\n“What, this,” she smiled and nervously laughed it off, “That’s just the newest style. Broken and internally scared,” She then dabbed with her wand and shouted out random pop cultural phrases.\n\nHe continued inside, confused as he rubbed the left forearm of his coat, “I am old...”\n\nOutside, Star contemplated on what to do with “Gustav”."
 CAL_GUSTAV.3.a:0 "“That sad little boy isn’t worth my time.”"
 CAL_GUSTAV.3.b:0 "“Mark my word, he’ll regret coming back here...”"
 
 CAL_GUSTAV.4.t:0 "Star Story"
 CAL_GUSTAV.4.d:0 "Star quickly slides down the stairs while yelling about a new dance that was popular and the new pop song that she had on repeat. Her plan was to be a distraction for Marco and his parents while the laser puppies she unleashed outside set stuffon fire in the backyard so she could have a direct conversation while “Gustav”.\n\nThe plan went accordingly and the Diazs rushed out to the backyard trying to prevent more fires and put out all the ones the laser puppies had created, leaving “Gustav” on his own in the living room.\n\nStar quickly aimed her wand and yelled out to him “Hello, Charles Booth! Now please explain to me why in Corn’s name you’re back here instead of in that depressing town of yours. I know you most likely want something and I’m here to prevent it!”\n\nCharles sighed and asked Star, speaking in his regular Bakerfieldvillian voice “What do you want this time to convince you I’m not here to murder the Diaz family or something like that?”\n\n“I want you out of this house and to never come back!” She demands loudly.\n\n“Well I’m not doing that so you better get used to dealing with me. Even as our own nation, California still ignores my hometown. But with the Kerfuffle? This is my chance to fix that. And don’t try to stop me. I mean you didn’t expose me the first time. Poor Rafael, Angie, and Marco would be devastated that you didn’t tell them the truth,” He coughed and spoke again with his scandinavian accent “We are stuck together, ja? Like you Americans call it, you are Woody and I am the Buzz of Lightyear, no?”\n\nStar groaned."
 CAL_GUSTAV.4.a:0 "“You most certainly don’t have a friend in me!”"
 
 CAL_GUSTAV.5.t:0 "Multi Level Meatball"
 CAL_GUSTAV.5.d:0 "“Hej Diaz Family. Jag har a big favor to ask of you three,” The Diazs and Gustav were in the living room, “I am planning on opening up my very own restaurang or as you Americans call it, restaurant here in Echo Creek. It will be off of my world famous meatballs. I’m still deciding on names but it would either be Gustavs köttbullsemporium or Gustavs kjøttkakeremporium” he said through a strange mix of a Swedish and a Norwegian accent.\n\nAngie Diaz quickly asked him about more details sounding incredibly excited before she finally said on a quick pace “Oh my goodness. Yes Gustav we would love to invest into your amazing danish dishes. Take all of our money. I have full faith within you to make this worth it.”\n\nRaefael and Marco nodded their heads in agreement. All of them could be heard spouting some random business words like “ownership percentages” and “mortgages” which sounded like fictional languages to Star who had listened into the conversation from the stairs.\n\nStar aimed her wand forward whispering some words to a cupcake explosion spell before she aimed the wand to the floor as she started to plan to expose him to the entire family that he was in fact some loser from Bakersfieldville. She spent one last moment, holding the explosive cupcake to think about whether to do so. Then she bolted towards the Diaz family panting and through her panting yelled out."
 CAL_GUSTAV.5.a:0 "“Stop! He’s no true Scandinavian! Don’t invest”"
 CAL_GUSTAV.5.b:0 "“Gutsav’s idea... is brilliant! I think you should invest!”"
 
 CAL_GUSTAV.6.t:0 "Baking in Bakersfieldville"
 CAL_GUSTAV.6.d:0 "With Star’s intervention, the talk of investing into “Gustav's” restaurant fell through. But what she didn’t expect was Charles quickly turning the situation around on Star about how she never told the Diazs about him and used his sad Bakerfieldvillian puppy face to still gain sympathy. Star was shocked as they agreed to help Charles’ idea to bring happiness with a restaurant in Bakersfieldville itself.\n\nIn no time at all, Star stood in front of Gustav’s restaurant in Bakersfieldville. The tables inside and out were full with both happy locals and out-of-towners. With the skills he gained from his multiple foreigh exchange student personas, his restaurant had a wide range of food and garnished popularity across the state. As News Channels from San Francisco and Los Angeles were interviewing him, Star and Hector were at the side lines.\n\n“Star. What did I tell you not to do?” he said, horrified at the entire sight.\n\n“Not to involve Bakersfieldvillie... But I stopped him from taking your family’s money!”\n\n“Rafael is an artist and Angie is a stay at home mother. I bought their house for them as a wedding gift. Even Marco has more money than them! But now all the attention is here. Everyone in the state feels bad for him and this sad city.”\n\nLady Everett walked in, “And the political chaos it causes is great. The state representatives for the city just introduced a bill to “solve” North and South tensions... by moving the state capital here!”\n\n“¡Dios mío! And the polling?”\n\n“90%! If we order the assembly to vote it down now, the government will collapse. Norton has to sign it now!” She turned to Star, “And you, Princess Star. Your mother will hear about this in the next series of trade negotiations!”\n\nAs Everett walked off, Hector broke down to his knees and started crying. Then he took out his to-go tray of meatballs and began eating them as he cried, “I don’t want to work here... these things are good.”\n\nStar groaned at the whole situation as Charles walked over to her, “Gotta say Star. If it wasn’t for you. None of this would be possible! I and Bakersfieldville owe you our thanks.”\n\nShe aimed her wand at him."
 CAL_GUSTAV.6.a:0 "“Narwhal Blast”" 
 
 CAL_GUSTAV.8.t:0 "Bill 040-620-15"
 CAL_GUSTAV.8.d:0 "As protesters outside rallied and chanted, the main assembly for the state of California have gathered in the main assembly hall. Bill 040-620-15 has been introduced and was now up for vote by the elected officlas of the Imperial Republic. In an odd order, the "NAYS" were counted first. Only a very few and vocal assembly members shouted "NAY" as they kept clicking their "NAY" button on thier desk.\n\nWhen the "YEA" votes were called for, the two assemblymen from District 32 and 34 shouted with a gleaful "YEA". The rest of the hall eithered whipers a reluctant yea, or just pressed the "YEA" button before slouching in their seats.\n\n"We have the votes! 65 YEA, 10 NAY, 5 Abstain. Bill 040-620-15, The Relocation of the Capital of California to Bakersfieldville has Passed!" Almost everyone groaned at the thought. Then the next agenda was announced, "We will now open the floor for our next agenda. Reevaulcation of Diplomatic and Trade Relations with The Kingdom of Mewni."\n\nThere was a flurry as everyone stood up and began shouting their demands and ideas. All of it was aimed not at the speaker, but Star and Lt. Governor Diaz-Guzman at the sidelines.\n\n"Cut All Ties!"\n\n"Full Embrago!"\n\n"We demand the Emperor arm our nukes in Amargosa Valley and glass them to Hell... Then glass their underworld as well!"\n\nStar turned to hector, "I think they're mad at me...""

 CAL_MILITARY.1.t:0 "The Call To Service"
 CAL_MILITARY.1.d:0 "As he carried a cup of tea down the hallway, Sherman “Shermie” Pines looked at the old photos hanging on the wall. He looked on first at the photos of his grandchildren, including a recent image of them with Dipper’s brown cap and Mabel’s shooting star sweater. Next was of his own children, from a summer trip with them to Disneyland Pyeongyang in the 80s to Eugene Pines when he graduated from UC Emeryville to his daughter Emily Pines in her Marines formal Dress after she was promoted to Captain. Finally, he chuckled to himself looking at a poorly timed photo of him socking his brother Stanford Pines as Ford tried to hog the new born twins from him. But he stopped at the last photo on the wall. There laid a photo of him at the docks of Newark before his first deployment, playing around with both of his brothers, Stanford and Stanley Pines. He sighed and walked away.\n\nAs he sat down with his wife Angelica and turned to the TV where an ad of “Norton For Governor” was on, he received a call on his cell phone, which Angelica was playing Candy Smasher on. He took the phone back and answered it."
 CAL_MILITARY.1.a:0 "“This is Sherman Pines... Governor Green?!” "
 
 CAL_MILITARY.6.t:0 "Recalled to Service"
 CAL_MILITARY.6.d:0 "“You want me to command the National Guard?”\n\n“Not just them,” said Governor Green in his office in Sacramento, “Several army officers and even the Marines at Fort Pendleton say they’ll stay in California instead of heading East if you assume control. Any hopes to protecting California and restoring the US rest on you returning to service.”\n\nWith Norton only days away from assuming control as the new Governor of California, the outgoing Gerald Green was making sure California was ready with some sane leadership. If war broke out, having Pines fighting for California can bring many military units to side with them and the Hero of Mesopotamia. Likewise, Shermie knew him in control of the military was equally for internal security as any external one.\n\n“I know you called me here over Norton, Governor Green.”\n\n“Norton, yes. But more so, my and soon his Lieutenant Governor, Hector Diaz-Guzman. Have you ever met the man before?” asked Green.\n\n“We talked on the elevator ride up here, actually. He remembered meeting me, right before Nixon pinned a medal on me. Not sure why he was there in the White House. I assumed he was Secret Service. Very young to be one at the time, though.”\n\n“He’s a former, hopefully, agent. I’m not sure which Alphabet Agency and I pulled every connection in Washington before and after the Kerfuffle. With his heavy clout in the South, I’m just as worried about him as this Emperor of ours. But still. We will all need you, General Pines. Do you accept?”\n\nHe thought about it, remembering he will now be facing off against Oregon, where his brother and grandchildren were.\n\n“I hope fighting doesn’t break out. Even in victory, we won’t win.”"
 CAL_MILITARY.6.a:0 "“With you, who would dare oppose California?”" 
 
 CAL_MILITARY.2.t:0 "To the shores of California"
 CAL_MILITARY.2.d:0 "“Stay down and be quiet!” Emily said to her lieutenant and sergeant.\n\n“We been coop up in that container for nearly a week, Major. Have you smelled Adams?”\n\n“If the Pentagon caught your scent, Charlie, they think it’s a chemical attack and nuke us.”\n\nEmily chuckled a bit, “Well, if we can make contact with General Pines, he can bail our asses out. Yours’ a second time Adams.”\n\n“Copy that, Major.”\n\nThe three of them sneaked their way to the gangway on the cargo ship to the docks of San Diego below. As they stepped on dry land, a swarm of vehicles marked “I.B.I.” surrounded them as helicopters flew above head. Agents quickly stepped out and raised their weapons as their commander walked up to them.\n\n“Major Emily Pines. 4th Marine Engineering Battalion, am I correct,” asked Hector Diaz-Guzman.\n\n“That’s correct.” She said, hands raised, “We’re here to fight for California and General Pines!”\n\n“Oh don’t worry,” he waved his agents to stand down, “We caught word of that a few days ago,” Hector chuckled, “That’s some journey. I’d half expect you simply have your marines take control of the ship.”\n\n“My marines are best the Corps has to offer. We're engineers, not pirates. That’s what the Navy’s for.”\n\n“I don’t doubt you, Major. Come with me, your father has been awaiting you all week at Fort Pendleton. Your subordinates can work with my agents to get your men treated,” Hector grabbed something from the van and tossed it to Emily’s XOs, “This should keep them busy.”\n\n“Awesome, crayons!” said Charlie.\n\nEmily looked at Hector with annoyed disbelief."
 CAL_MILITARY.2.a:0 "“Hey, it worked on CIA agents also...”"
 
 CAL_MILITARY.3.t:0 "The Sierra Army Depot"
 CAL_MILITARY.3.d:0 "Our engineers report that the tanks at the Sierra Army Depot are in rougher shape then we expected. Some private Northwest contractor engineers with them say they can break down the tanks and figure out how to reverse-engineer the tank parts. We'll have to rebuild them, but we will now have the expertice to actually build and maintain them for future use.\n\nAt the very least, we have plenty of useful small arms and supplies we can take from the depot to supply the main Imperial Army."
 CAL_MILITARY.3.b:0 "Our engineers report that the tanks at the Sierra Army Depot are in good shape. We can deploy the tanks immediately to service!\n\nA small bit of bad news though. All the surpluss equipment like rifles and rations were apperently all left out in the open during the winter and now are rendered beyond operation or repair. If only Field Marshall Pines was commanding the US Army, this would have never happened! Still, truley it is a feat of Mother Nature and the great Sierra Nevada to destory such robust equipment. Oh well..."
 CAL_MILITARY.3.a:0 "We shall make do!"
 
 CAL_MILITARY.4.t:0 "What have we learned?"
 CAL_MILITARY.4.d:0 "As helicopters and hummers buzzed about Fort Navarro, Sherman Pines and his staff were busy reviewing old and captured US Military records of performance from the Second World War to the present. The room was full of skilled and experienced theorist working to achieve one thing, determine what was there to learn from all these reports and evaluations.\n\nFor all the victories in the Cold War, there were many notable defeats and learning from both was crucial as far as Pines was concern. As preliminary conclusions were made, three different competing conclusions formed among the officers.\n\nPines read each of their summaries and what should be the main takeaway for California and the United States after half a century of fighting."

 CAL_MILITARY.5.t:0 "Private Security Contracts"
 CAL_MILITARY.5.d:0 "With our main army and personal deployed either at the borders or off-dimension, the state is pressed for security personnel for critical infrastructure and facilities. We do however have access to private contractors we can hire to do the job.\n\nRight now, the two biggest we can choose is Northwest of California’s Mil-Tech, a US favorite, and Imperial Japan’s Arisaka based from Night City. Mil-Tech has plenty of former US soldiers, so integration with our troops is easier. But they take up more resource trains to supply. Arisaka troops are better trained, but our politicians don’t like foreign private mega-corps and they cost more. Likewise, our people hate both and view it highly hypocritical that California of all states would hire them.\n\nNow, we could secretly sign deals with both of them and weaken them both by pitting them against each other. It’s a bit of drain on manpower and makes them both less efficient in their real job. But the people would get a sick kick of mercs aimlessly dying while fighting each other. Thanks Valve. \n\nLast, we could just stretch our lines and keep things directly in our control."

 CAL_fleet_event.1.t:0 "Trans-Pacific Trade"
 CAL_fleet_event.1.d:0 "Surprisingly, the Pacific Fleet is holding out better than we expected. The fleet has been able to hold off against aggression from China, Japan, India, and Australia. They even successfully integrated with the Canadian Pacific Flotilla after they escaped Canadian Okinawa when the Japanese Imperial Defense Fleet took it back. Still, the situation in Asia is tense and the Admiralty made it clear to General Pines that if the Fleet leaves, our states from Chukotka to South Vietnam will quickly fall to Russian, SEATO, or former Commonwealth forces.\n\nStill, supplies are tight. Besides burning dirty fuel from reactivated refineries from Alaska, the fleet needs food and supplies, which we have. Keeping things unofficial, Admiral Park is willing to “look the other way” and let some ships go AWOL and sail for California. We would in turn send rations and ordinance. Here is a list of what ships the Pacific Fleet “can do without.”"

 CAL_fleet_event.2.t:0 "Adrian Levi Curtis' Pride"
 CAL_fleet_event.2.d:0 "The newest aircraft carrier in the US Navy, the USS Adrian Levi Curtis was originally a "gift" from Congress when everyone thought President Curtis succeeded in getting the Philippines to vote for Union Admission. (They voted 89% against, with many poll takers having promptly disappeared since then). Though more advance than the old and famed Halsey Class Aircraft Carrier, the ship needs new parts to maintain, and all of those parts were stored and shipped from the East Coast.\n\nBut it was Northwest of California that designed her and could build new parts. For a big trade, we could take the ship off their hands and run it ourselves. The massive shipment in food, fuel, and munitions will keep the fleet secure for weeks to come. Hopefully, the situation in the United States would have changed for the better."
