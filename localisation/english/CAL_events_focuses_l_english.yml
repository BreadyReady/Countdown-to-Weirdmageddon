 CAL_JANNA.1.t:0 "Internship"
 CAL_JANNA.1.d:0 "Hector Diaz-Guzman. Lieutenant Governor of California. A fit yet aging man, the man sat in his chair, staring up at the ceiling and contemplating his life at this moment. He opened his drawer and pulled out a solid metal forearm bracelet. It was adorned with unique engravings of his hispanic roots and the center was a crystal star that radiated a low power resonance. Hector thought of the old life he had and all that had lead up to today. It was then there was a knock on his office door. His secretary was already gone for the day, so he went over to personally open the door to see who it was.\n\n"Sup, DeeGee." Said Janna.\n\nAfter a moment, he recognized her, "Oh hey, you're that kid that torments Marco. What are you doing in Sac-Town?"\n\n"My Parents said to get a summer job and word is you need an aid. Of the subversion sort of task, political brokering, cooresion, investigating. That kind of stuff."\n\n"And a 15 year old girl can do the job of a political strongman?"\n\nJanna chuckled, "You underestimate me. A sample of my work," She handed him a folder, "He doesn't even know."\n\nHector read through the folder, "So you have my grandnephew's SSN and detailed information... oh, so that's his middle name. This is both criminal and not really hard to get, Janna. Just go back to Echo Creek and don't open a line of credit under Marco's name."\n\nShe seemingly gave up quickly and shrugged her shoulders, "Oh well. If that's what you want. Former Deputy Director Hector Diaz of the Federal Paranormal Investigations!"\n\nHector pulled her into his office and slammed the door. He pulled out his .223 pistol instinctually before re-holstering it as it was just a teenage girl. Janna all the while smiled at Hector's provocation. "How do you know that?"\n\n"Better you put my skills to work digging into other people's history than your own. Wouldn't you say?"\n\nHector looked at her straight, "I can have you extracted and unpersoned, Janna Ordonia."\n\nShe matched his glance and pulled out a food container from her backpack, "I brought Lumpia."\n\n"Done!" He grabbed the container and began eating the lumpia, "I'll have you placed on some internship. Come back tomorrow morning and we'll start your training."\n\n"Nice""
 CAL_JANNA.1.a:0 ""Do I get a gun like yours also?""

 CAL_JANNA.11.t:0 "The Manna Heresy"
 CAL_JANNA.11.d:0 "Through the busy streets of Port Festiva, Star, Marco, and Janna made their way to the Californian Embassy. Passing through the gates and into the building, they walked up to the office of the Imperial Bureau of Investigations. They walked in to be greeted by Marco’s Uncle, Californian Lieutenant Governor Hector Diaz-Guzman. “Oh good, you three are here. Janne, we need to talk,” He said as they all sat down.\n\n“Is this about those Jaggy Royal Court hostages?”\n\n“What hostages? Uhg, never mind that," Hector handed her a folder, “Word from the Forest of Certain Death is that a Death Cult has emerged. And Apparently they worship you as their leader!”\n\nJanna smiled, “That? Oh yeah, I needed a safe house and they offered to accommodate me,” she turned to Marco, “I got a real silver tongue here.”\n\nHe crossed his arms and grumbled, “Still want my $650 back from that Ponzi scheme...”\n\n“Is that bad?” asked Star.\n\n“Heh, probably not,” Hector handed Janna another file, “But I got new intel on them. Her role has escalated to borderline deity. And with that comes some odd shippings by them.”\n\nJanna took look, “There’s a sect called the “Order of Janstar?”\n\n“What?” Star took the file, “They’re shipping you and me?! We got to stop them.”\n\nJanne took the file back and placed her arm around Star, getting very close to her, “Hold on, this could be interesting. We can use this to our advantage.”\n\nHector coughed, “There is also another, uh, competing sect,” He handed her another file.\n\n“Oh, I wonder what that could... The Manna Brotherhood? Oh, ew, no! Not me and Marco.”\n\n“Haha!” laughed Marco.\n\nShe stood up walked to the fireplace and punched a brick. The wall above opened up and a rack of firearms came out. She grabbed a P90 and tossed a Berett .50 Cal to Marco, who was promptly pinned to the ground by its weight. “Star, open a portal. Time to purge some heretics for the Emperor.”\n\nHector walked over in mild annoyance and grabbed the P90, “No Janna. These sects come and go. I won’t authorized use of force.” He placed the weapons back, “Just be careful next time who you interact with. Now go be platonic with each other somewhere else.”"

 CAL_GUSTAV.1.t:0 "The Gustav Kerfuffle"
 CAL_GUSTAV.1.d:0 "On a quiet morning, the doorbell rang at the Diaz Residence.\n\n“I’ll get it!” yelled Star from upstairs.\n\nDownstairs in the kitchen, Marco walked over to the stairs, “Don’t worry Star. I can get it- Ah!”\n\nStar slid down the stair railing, banking a hard left and slamming into Marco. As he laid on the ground, Star stuck the landing and walked over to the front door. “Like I said. I got it!” She opened the door. “Hello...” Her enthusiasm dropped suddenly.\n\n“Hello Star! My fellow exchange student from the land of Mewni!”\n\n“G-Gustav?”\n\nMarco quickly got back up when he heard that name and rushed over to the door, shoving Star aside, “Gustav!”\n\n“Marco, my American friend! How good it is to see you,” they exchanged their long secret handshake as Rafael and Angie rushed over, “Mr and Mrs. Diaz. It is so wonderful to see you, ja?”\n\n“Gustav!”\n\nAs the four of them walked into the living room, conversing about, Star stared at Gustav with distrust."
 CAL_GUSTAV.1.a:0 "“Gustav...”"
 
 CAL_GUSTAV.2.t:0 "Permanent Exchange Student"
 CAL_GUSTAV.2.d:0 "“And there I was, swimming across the Atlantic with a baby seal on my back. I crossed the finish line, set a new world record as fastest swimmer across the Atlantic and reunited that seal with its mother,” he began to shed a tear, Star rolling her eyes, “That was when I heard my beloved homeland of Scandinavia was swept away by the Kerfuffle. The EU Ambassador told me I was the last Scandinavian left on Earth...” He paused as everyone but Star at the dinner table looked on in sadness. He continued, “So I traveled here, to my favorite American Family. I couldn’t even return to Europe. What with, as the Franco-Germans call it, the Third Weltkrieg about to occur and all.”\n\n“You’re safe here with us, Gustav. Mi Casa es Su Casa!” said Rafael.\n\n“And you can rest assured, Gustav,” said Marco’s granduncle Hector as he shoved another meatball into his mouth, “Until the end of the Canadian and Scandinavian Kerfuffle, you are welcome here in the great state of California.”\n\n“Si!” Rafael ate another meatball.\n\n“Oh Diazs, your hospitality warms my cold scandinavian heart!”\n\nStar scoffed at his comment as she poked her meatball, “Yeah, scandinavian...”\n\nHector finished his plate, “I’m going to grab some fresh air. Rafael.”\n\n“Tio Hector.”\n\nThe Lieutenant Governor walked out the back door and leaned against the wall. He took out an e-cigarette and took a puff before taking out his phone. “Now, let’s see what's the status of Project Golden-”"
 CAL_GUSTAV.2.a:0 "Hector!" 
 
 CAL_GUSTAV.3.t:0 "A Smoke and Meatballs"
 CAL_GUSTAV.3.d:0 "Hector dropped his phone and cigarette and scrambled to pick it up. He turned to see Star outside with him. “Star, you startled me. Was there something you needed?”\n\n“You used to be a secret spy, right?”\n\n“What I did is classified. You can't prove anything.”\n\n“What? No, I don't care about that. It's about Gustav. I know something Marco and his parents don’t know.”\n\nHector sighed in relief, “Oh that. You realized the twerp isn’t from Scandinavia?”\n\nStar looked at him in bewilderment, “You knew?”\n\n“I don’t need to be a spy to know that. The kid has Bakersfieldville written over him the moment I met him,” he took another puff, “But dang, doesn’t he make a mean meatball? Besides, he’s harmless.”\n\n“But Marco and Mr. and Mrs. Diaz?”\n\n“Rafael and Angie are not... the most observant people. For Marco, I am a bit disappointed in him for not seeing through the Gustav shtick. His grandfather Jaun had a keen eye.”\n\nMarco walked out the door with the trash, “What are you two talking about?”\n\nHector suddenly panicked, “Huh, just diplomatic stuff. Corn trades with Mewni and all.”\n\nStar turned to Hector, “Yeah, uh... Would You Be Interested In A Trade Agreement With Mewni?”\n\nMarco shrugged, tossed the trash and walked back inside. Hector turned to Star, “Leave it alone, Star. If there's one thing Californians can agree on, besides those dang Texans, is that acknowledging Bakersfieldville only leads to trouble...” As he went back inside, he noticed Star’s wand and the split star on it, “Is your wand okay?”\n\n“What, this,” she smiled and nervously laughed it off, “That’s just the newest style. Broken and internally scared,” She then dabbed with her wand and shouted out random pop cultural phrases.\n\nHe continued inside, confused as he rubbed the left forearm of his coat, “I am old...”\n\nOutside, Star contemplated on what to do with “Gustav”."
 CAL_GUSTAV.3.a:0 "“That sad little boy isn’t worth my time.”"
 CAL_GUSTAV.3.b:0 "“Mark my word, he’ll regret coming back here...”"
 
 CAL_GUSTAV.4.t:0 "Star Story"
 CAL_GUSTAV.4.d:0 "Star quickly slides down the stairs while yelling about a new dance that was popular and the new pop song that she had on repeat. Her plan was to be a distraction for Marco and his parents while the laser puppies she unleashed outside set stuffon fire in the backyard so she could have a direct conversation while “Gustav”.\n\nThe plan went accordingly and the Diazs rushed out to the backyard trying to prevent more fires and put out all the ones the laser puppies had created, leaving “Gustav” on his own in the living room.\n\nStar quickly aimed her wand and yelled out to him “Hello, Charles Booth! Now please explain to me why in Corn’s name you’re back here instead of in that depressing town of yours. I know you most likely want something and I’m here to prevent it!”\n\nCharles sighed and asked Star, speaking in his regular Bakerfieldvillian voice “What do you want this time to convince you I’m not here to murder the Diaz family or something like that?”\n\n“I want you out of this house and to never come back!” She demands loudly.\n\n“Well I’m not doing that so you better get used to dealing with me. Even as our own nation, California still ignores my hometown. But with the Kerfuffle? This is my chance to fix that. And don’t try to stop me. I mean you didn’t expose me the first time. Poor Rafael, Angie, and Marco would be devastated that you didn’t tell them the truth,” He coughed and spoke again with his scandinavian accent “We are stuck together, ja? Like you Americans call it, you are Woody and I am the Buzz of Lightyear, no?”\n\nStar groaned."
 CAL_GUSTAV.4.a:0 "“You most certainly don’t have a friend in me!”"
 
 CAL_GUSTAV.5.t:0 "Multi Level Meatball"
 CAL_GUSTAV.5.d:0 "“Hej Diaz Family. Jag har a big favor to ask of you three,” The Diazs and Gustav were in the living room, “I am planning on opening up my very own restaurang or as you Americans call it, restaurant here in Echo Creek. It will be off of my world famous meatballs. I’m still deciding on names but it would either be Gustavs köttbullsemporium or Gustavs kjøttkakeremporium” he said through a strange mix of a Swedish and a Norwegian accent.\n\nAngie Diaz quickly asked him about more details sounding incredibly excited before she finally said on a quick pace “Oh my goodness. Yes Gustav we would love to invest into your amazing danish dishes. Take all of our money. I have full faith within you to make this worth it.”\n\nRaefael and Marco nodded their heads in agreement. All of them could be heard spouting some random business words like “ownership percentages” and “mortgages” which sounded like fictional languages to Star who had listened into the conversation from the stairs.\n\nStar aimed her wand forward whispering some words to a cupcake explosion spell before she aimed the wand to the floor as she started to plan to expose him to the entire family that he was in fact some loser from Bakersfieldville. She spent one last moment, holding the explosive cupcake to think about whether to do so. Then she bolted towards the Diaz family panting and through her panting yelled out."
 CAL_GUSTAV.5.a:0 "“Stop! He’s no true Scandinavian! Don’t invest”"
 CAL_GUSTAV.5.b:0 "“Gutsav’s idea... is brilliant! I think you should invest!”"
 
 CAL_GUSTAV.6.t:0 "Baking in Bakersfieldville"
 CAL_GUSTAV.6.d:0 "With Star’s intervention, the talk of investing into “Gustav's” restaurant fell through. But what she didn’t expect was Charles quickly turning the situation around on Star about how she never told the Diazs about him and used his sad Bakerfieldvillian puppy face to still gain sympathy. Star was shocked as they agreed to help Charles’ idea to bring happiness with a restaurant in Bakersfieldville itself.\n\nIn no time at all, Star stood in front of Gustav’s restaurant in Bakersfieldville. The tables inside and out were full with both happy locals and out-of-towners. With the skills he gained from his multiple foreigh exchange student personas, his restaurant had a wide range of food and garnished popularity across the state. As News Channels from San Francisco and Los Angeles were interviewing him, Star and Hector were at the side lines.\n\n“Star. What did I tell you not to do?” he said, horrified at the entire sight.\n\n“Not to involve Bakersfieldvillie... But I stopped him from taking your family’s money!”\n\n“Rafael is an artist and Angie is a stay at home mother. I bought their house for them as a wedding gift. Even Marco has more money than them! But now all the attention is here. Everyone in the state feels bad for him and this sad city.”\n\nLady Everett walked in, “And the political chaos it causes is great. The state representatives for the city just introduced a bill to “solve” North and South tensions... by moving the state capital here!”\n\n“¡Dios mío! And the polling?”\n\n“90%! If we order the assembly to vote it down now, the government will collapse. Norton has to sign it now!” She turned to Star, “And you, Princess Star. Your mother will hear about this in the next series of trade negotiations!”\n\nAs Everett walked off, Hector broke down to his knees and started crying. Then he took out his to-go tray of meatballs and began eating them as he cried, “I don’t want to work here... these things are good.”\n\nStar groaned at the whole situation as Charles walked over to her, “Gotta say Star. If it wasn’t for you. None of this would be possible! I and Bakersfieldville owe you our thanks.”\n\nShe aimed her wand at him."
 CAL_GUSTAV.6.a:0 "“Narwhal Blast”" 
 
 CAL_GUSTAV.7.t:0 "The Echo of Good Food"
 CAL_GUSTAV.7.d:0 "Eager to invest with Star’s support, the Diazs were quick to agree. They gave most of their money, which actually wasn't a lot given their occupation. Nonetheless, it took no time to open a new restaurant in downtown Echo Creek due to the economic downturn and to raving fanfare. With “Gustav” as the owner, the restaurant had several chefs of different nationalities to give a world-wide menu. All of them were just different personas of Charles, from his french cuisine, italian cooking, to soul food and asian fusion.\n\nHector took a bite of his chowmein, “Heh, Thai Go does it better.”\n\n“This is good fried chicken though,” said Janna.\n\nStar took a bite of Gustav’s meatballs for the first time and was pleasantly surprised, “These are pretty good actually.”\n\n“By the way. Thank you Star for not doing anything rash with our friend “Gustav” here. The less we have to talk about Bakersfield, the better.”\n\nGustav came over to their table, “Star, Governor, girl who scares me, it is good you came to my restaurang, ja?” He placed down another plate of meatballs, “Please, eat to your heart's content.”\n\nHector nodded, “We certainly will,” He then grabbed him by the collar and pulled him in, “And I expect you to pay back my nephew every cent he invested into you. Or you’ll be going back to that sad sack city you call “Scandinavia” in a body bag. Understood?!”\n\nGustav voice cracked and he barely responded in his normal voice, “Y-Y-Yes Mr. Diaz- Lieutenant Governor Diaz-Guzman!”\n\nHe quickly scurried away. The two girls smiled. All three of them forked a meatball and toasted with it."
 CAL_GUSTAV.7.a:0 "“Skål”"
 
 CAL_GUSTAV.8.t:0 "Bill 040-620-15"
 CAL_GUSTAV.8.d:0 "As protesters outside rallied and chanted, the main assembly for the state of California have gathered in the main assembly hall. Bill 040-620-15 has been introduced and was now up for vote by the elected officlas of the Imperial Republic. In an odd order, the "NAYS" were counted first. Only a very few and vocal assembly members shouted "NAY" as they kept clicking their "NAY" button on thier desk.\n\nWhen the "YEA" votes were called for, the two assemblymen from District 32 and 34 shouted with a gleaful "YEA". The rest of the hall eithered whipers a reluctant yea, or just pressed the "YEA" button before slouching in their seats.\n\n"We have the votes! 65 YEA, 10 NAY, 5 Abstain. Bill 040-620-15, The Relocation of the Capital of California to Bakersfieldville has Passed!" Almost everyone groaned at the thought. Then the next agenda was announced, "We will now open the floor for our next agenda. Reevaulcation of Diplomatic and Trade Relations with The Kingdom of Mewni."\n\nThere was a flurry as everyone stood up and began shouting their demands and ideas. All of it was aimed not at the speaker, but Star and Lt. Governor Diaz-Guzman at the sidelines.\n\n"Cut All Ties!"\n\n"Full Embrago!"\n\n"We demand the Emperor arm our nukes in Amargosa Valley and glass them to Hell... Then glass their underworld as well!"\n\nStar turned to hector, "I think they're mad at me...""

We have many politicians from all three sides of the party ready to give you support on other measuers, as long as you sign this bill."\n\nHe nodded, "I suppose so.

 CAL_Witcher_Event.1.t:0 "Of Monsters and Men"
 CAL_Witcher_Event.1.d:0 "An interesting, and possibly worrying, message has arrived from the European Consulate in Los Angeles. As we expanded more of our interest into Mewni, we welcomed any nation to join us in establishing diplomatic relationships with the kingdoms in Mewni. Given the current state of the world, only the EU, Mexico, and the Exiled Canadians sent a team through the mewman portal. Oregon refused and admittedly, we’re glad they said no before we did.\n\nApparently, an issue has developed. One of their main security officers, a young Polish-Lithuanian man, has disappeared while on Mewni. They had determined the Pol-Lit had ran off and is now roaming the mewman countryside without EU supervision. The EU consulate is not happy about this turn of development.\n\nThey approached us to inform the Butterfly Court and to assist in searching for the man. It is a bit odd that the EU is coming to us. According to Lt. Governor Diaz, the EU doesn’t even need to bother going to us to travel to Mewni; their FPI counterpart, the EIO, has portal technology. But they clearly want to keep that secret and since they wish to keep things formal, it’s in our best interest to deal with the matter ourselves. Winning EU support for California would be vital in the eventual reclaimage of the United States."
 CAL_Witcher_Event.1.a:0 "Polish-Lithuanian can into Mewni!"
 
 CAL_Witcher_Event.2.t:0 "Toss A Coin To Your Pol-Lit!"
 CAL_Witcher_Event.2.d:0 "To no one’s surprise, mewni knight Sir Pointy has informed Major Pines that they had a report of a human wandering blindly into the Forest of Certain Death. As we do not want to bring a dead Pol-Lit to the Franco-Germans, Major Pines ordered a marine strike force to quickly find him. As our forces discreatle entered a Johansen village in the Boggabah Swamp, we found the man in a bar. Unfortunately, things got more complicated from there.\n\nApparently, the man was dressed in armor, wielding a silver sword, and dawned long white hair and was being cheered on by the townsfolk as “Andrez of Lodz” and “Monster Slayer”. Discussing with one of the marines, it became clear what had happened. The man is going around the mewman countryside, pretending to be a Witcher, from the popular Pol-Lit novel and game series. Radioing back to Pines at Butterfly Castle, the news of the event has shocked us, the EU ambassador, and members of the royal court. Our response, however differed.\n\nThe EU wants the man retrieved immediately. He’s a danger to EU funded monster relief in the region. The Butterfly Court has voiced their objection. Having someone slaying monsters is perfectly fine to them, if not encouraged given the boost in morale for the mewmans. We are in a position to strike now and take him, but we risk hurting our relationship with the Butterflys, and vice versa with the EU if we let him continue. Major Pines has a plan though and we await word from Emperor Norton on the matter."
 CAL_Witcher_Event.2.a:0 "Nabbed the dumb Pol-Lit before he hurts himself!"
 CAL_Witcher_Event.2.b:0 "Toss a coin to your Witcher, oh Boggabah of Plenty!"
 CAL_Witcher_Event.2.c:0 "Major Pines, your idea?"
 
 CAL_Witcher_Event.3.t:0 "Destiny Beckons!"
 CAL_Witcher_Event.3.d:0 "After discussing the plan with the Mewmans and the EU, both agreed on the odd plan. Having a monster slayer benefits the stability situation and having a Pol-Lit taking lead in unknowingly improving relationships with a intermindentional power looks good for an EU wanting to feel diversified. Naturally, the moron will have to be retrieved before he encounters a monster he can't handle, which likely won’t be long. That's where Pines' plan comes in.\n\nWe need to, safely, make him grow exhausted from playing a Witcher. The EU agreed to financial support and it will be on us to coordinate. When asking for help from the mewmans, Princess Star Butterfly was eager to help and "volunteer" additional help, including the Queen herself who wasn't even aware this was all happening until Star dragged her and King River into the meeting room. Major Emily Pined laid the plan out.\n\nPines used the video game series as a basis, as our intel reports our "Witcher" likely never read the books, and probably would not even recognize the actual royalty of mewni despite their original job. Star will play the role of Princess Ciri, the Unicorn Foal of Mewni. For the role of the Sorceress Yennefer, Moon reluctantly agreed to play along as she already has full use of her magical powers. Finally, the newly appointed songstrel Ruberiot will be the barber Jaskier. Pined wanted to call him Dandelion, but he refused.\n\nThe plan was this. "Naturally" join up with our witcher and lead him to a trap, where River, Marco and a monster friend of Star, this apparently buffed frogman, will jump him and beat the heck out of him. Then when he gives up his dumb roleplaying, a team of European peacemakers would rescue him, then fine him for his actions.\n\nMoon objected to the plan, as unlike her servants in the royal court, she's okay with us just arresting him directly. But Star and the Californians are very eager to do the plan and the Franco-German Ambassador wants the Pol-Lit man to suffer, so it's clear this convoluted plan is going to happen."
 CAL_Witcher_Event.3.a:0 ""The crazed Human Plan it is then...""
 
 CAL_Witcher_Event.4.t:0 "Certain Adventure"
 CAL_Witcher_Event.4.d:0 ""And so he traveled the land, slaying beasts and demons for coin! Until he saved the young Princess Star, who he was destined to be joined! Then came the great sorceress Moon, with magic ever strong, she blasted the monsters away like a striking monsoon!" Ruberiot strumbed away on his lute, "And what about yours truly? The most talented of barbers, Jas-"\n\n"Jaskier, would you shut up?" Said Andrez with a fake grizzled and deep pitched voice.\n\n"Yeah, Ru- Jaskier!" Yelled Star.\n\n"Heavens, please," As Moon rubbed her forehead.\n\nThe four of them continued through the Forest of Certain Death, a fact for anyone wondering into it, yet it teamed with life that can quickly bring about death. The "Witcher" Andrez hacked their way through the thick vegetation as the others followed him. Moon noticed the seemingly rugged man struggling like any other inexperienced adventure to wield and cut through the vegetation with his sword. The sword he weld was not actually silver, but common metal clearly painted to gleam in the light. It was miraculous he was alive this long, this odd man. And yet her people were so quick to gravitate to this deranged man pretending to be some Earth story character. The Pol-Lit is too oblivious of the mockery he brought on himself. But Moon was aware of the subtle embarrassment that it was to her and the Mewman people.\n\n"Moon, are we near where the monsters are?” asked Andrez as they approached a small clearing in the middle of the forest.\n\n“We’re almost at the spot where the “villagers” said the monsters were at,” She looked up and nodded."
 CAL_Witcher_Event.4.a:0 "Above them, the “monsters” were in wait."
 
 CAL_Witcher_Event.5.t:0 "Burn, Pol-Lit, Burn!"
 CAL_Witcher_Event.5.d:0 "From up above, the three monsters jumped down and surrounded Andrez. Both River and Marco were dressed up in foliage, waving cut vines like they were tentacles, while Buff Frog croacked and inflated his chest to intimidate. Andrez pulled out his sword from behind and rushed at them, but was quickly dodged by each of them.\n\nAs Star and Moon shot out random magic blasts into the air to look like they were fighting, River struck first at the pol-lit. He dodged a swing and tackled him towards Marco, who unleashed his karate moves, landing a kick to his chest and a karate chop on his arm. As Andrez dropped his stance, Buff Frog spat out his tongue and grabbed the sword out of his hand. As they surrounded him, his companions fell to the ground on cue to look like they were defeated.\n\n“Give up Witcher, you can’t defeat us!”\n\nAndrez spoke in his poor impression of Geralt, “Three against one, aye? Doesn’t seem fair...” he cracked his knuckles, “For you three!”\n\n“What?”\n\nBuff Frog’s head went spinning as Andrez landed a hook. Before River could react, Andrez ran up to him and drop-kicked Rivers into the nearby stream. Before Marco could realize what was happening, the pol-lit engaged and Marco was suddenly struggling to block and dodge his attack. In no time at all, the “witcher” proved the better martial artist and with a roundhouse kick, he sent Marco flying into a nearby tree.\n\nStar looked on in disbelief, “What the... He actually knows how to fight?”\n\nMoon sighted, knowing this plan was going to fail in some horrible manner, “I’ll fix this Star.”\n\nAs Andrez picked up his sword and walked over to Buff Frog, ready to plunge his sword into the actual monster creature, Moon stood up and raised her hand at Andrez."
 CAL_Witcher_Event.5.a:0 "“Unicorn Thunder!”"
 
 CAL_Witcher_Event.6.t:0 "A Cleaved Convergence"
 CAL_Witcher_Event.6.d:0 "“This is by far... second worst job I ever took,” said Buff Frog as he sat on a log, icing his wounds.\n\n“I thought these “Pole-Lites” were a joke on Earth,” asked Star to Hector as his team of IBI agents strapt the badly burnt Andrez to a medical stretcher for evac.\n\nHector rolled his eyes as he held up an ice bag for Marco, “Dang Euros failed to mention he was a former special ops agent. Typical. And Pines will be reprimand for this stupid plan. What was I expecting from the marines...”\n\nMoon walked over, “Please just get him out of my kingdom.”\n\nHer royal servant opened up a portal back to the European Union. A woman stepped out of the portal as her EU Peacemaker soldiers surrounded Andrez’s stretcher. Still suffering a mild concussion from Moon’s magic blast, he instantly recognized who she was.\n\n“Ah! Supreme Chancellor Karolina Küchler!”\n\nShe gently padded his cheek, “There, there, mien dumm liebchen. Europa is here to take you to the safety of home,” the old German woman then tightly grabbed his neck, “And you’ll be appropriately disciplined for embarrassing the Euroreich!”\n\nHe coughed and groaned as the peacemakers took his stretcher through the portal. Küchler turned to Hector, “Ah, Hector Diaz. The EIO talks highly of you. I trust you have this under control.”\n\n“I certainly do.”\n\n“And the British do not know of this place, correct?”\n\n“Without Canada, they can barely leave their own island,” he said with assurance.\n\n“The British?” asked Moon.\n\nKüchler waved it off, “It’s nothing to concern yourself with, you highness. Queen Moon, Princess Star, Auf Wiedersehen.” She returned to Europe through the portal.\n\nExhausted, Moon walked away."

 CAL_IBI.1.t:0 "Kombucha On Tap"
 CAL_IBI.1.d:0 "There was a knock on the door.\n\n“Come in,” said Hector as he kept his eyes on the paper work on his desk.\n\nThe door opened. The first person was a seemingly unassuming officer worker, with a button up white shirt and thick glasses one would see from the analytic agents of the basement of some Bureau office. The other was clearly a field agent and a flamboyant one at that, with a burgundy suit and a lean fixture. They both walked in and the field agent spoke with a scuff.\n\n“Hector Diaz. Apologies, Diaz-Guzman. My my, I didn’t you of all people would be held down with a ring.”\n\nHector looked up, “X and Jenny. I didn’t think you two would still be wasting away in the FBI’s copy of my old employer.”\n\n“Says the one who formed “The Imperial Bureau of Investigations”, Mr. X laughed, “But we both know our status as a Federal employee is tenuous right now.”\n\n“Then don’t I have an opportunity for you and your UIU crew”, said Hector, “With the FPI in the North and the our involvement in Mewni, I need my personal agents watching those areas. Naturally that leaves traditional paranormal activities un-monitored across greater California. The SCP back east could barely do it before the Kerfuffle. So here’s a chance to show what the Unusual Investigations Unit has to offer.”\n\nMr. X nodded, “I’m interested. Naturally, unlike the Feds, I assume California and the Imps are better funded. We’ll need certain... provisions handled to do our job.”\n\nHector nodded, knowing a negotiation when he sees one, “What does the UIU need?” Jenny pulled out a stack of files from out of nowhere and dropped it on Hector’s desk. Hector stood up and began to to look through them, “A fleet of new armored vans, a type 5 compact fission reactor... Kombucha on tap?! You’re really pushing it, X! Dios mio, I’ll have to sell missiles to the Iranians to pay for this!”\n\n“Trust me, Hector. I could tell there's something amiss here in Los Angeles. Everyone’s too busy with some magic kingdom of rainbow and unicorns, when something else sinister from the multiverse is about to burst right in! Trust me, you want me and Jenny on the job to stop that.”\n\nHector sighed, “This better be worthwhile, X.”"
 CAL_IBI.1.a:0 "“I wonder if we do have missiles to sell?”"
 
 CAL_IBI.2.t:0 "The Next Generation"
 CAL_IBI.2.d:0 "“This is so exciting,” said Mr. Ordonia with a pinoy accent.\n\n“Yes. Our daughter, a government employee! What a stable job she has,” said Mrs. Ordonia.\n\nNext to them was Star, Marco and Tom. Star wondered, “I didn’t know they let a fifteen-year-old become a secret agent, like in your dad’s movies, Marco. That sounds cool!”\n\n“I really don’t trust Janna with a license to kill.”\n\n“No, I hear you Marco,” said Tom, “Sounds like more work for my parents...”\n\nThey sat with about several dozen other people in the stands of a small stadium outside Riverside. On the field were thirty graduating members of the Imperial Bureau of Investigation’s Academy. Janna sat in the first row as Hector took the stage to introduce them.\n\n“Hello everyone! I’m not sure how you got here since this was a classified event. But like the old Federal Government back east, we’ll blame the Russians and move on. Today we gather to commemorate the first class of the Imperial Bureau of Investigation. From crime solving, intelligence gathering, dimensional affairs and paranormal containment, these thirty are the finest the next generation has to offer. When the emperor reunited our great nation, many of you will surely have great futures ahead serving to protect America from the unknown. Some of you, standing before me now, I have come to know personally, such as my own pupil and the alma mater of this class, Janna Ordonia...”\n\n“The fact she’s the alma mater is already suspicious,” grumbled Marco.\n\n“Shhh!” Star silence him.\n\n“The future remains unwritten. We already determine time doesn’t work like that. So go forth into the great unknown. And maintain a low causality rate! Cheers for our new agents!”"
 CAL_IBI.2.a:0 "“Hip, Hip, Hurray!”"
 
 CAL_IBI.3.t:0 "Nothing To See Here"
 CAL_IBI.3.d:0 ""What are we even doing here, DeeGee?"\n\nAlong with a team of IBI agents, Hector and Janna were at a park in downtown LA. Near St. James Middle School, the park was the last reported place of three girls from the schools were seen before they disappeared a few months ago. The St. James Disappearance made national news, but for all the wrong reasons. Apparently, the news media focused on the caucasian girl of the group, Sasha Waybright, and ignored the two asian girls with her. This ended up sparking a debate of race that caused protests and riots and eventually drew all attention away from the disappearance itself. With no real progress made, the IBI hoped to bring the case to a close as an easy first step to bringing order in California.\n\n“Look around, Janna. We’re here to see if we can find new evidence on their disappearance.”\n\nShe leaned back on a lamp post, “I thought we’re going to do the paranormal part of the IBI, not the boring, “kidnapped and murdered” cases.”\n\n“Then look for that angle then,” Hector gestured to their surroundings, “Besides, I promised Anna’s mother we’ll get to the bottom of this and wherever it leads, we go!”\n\n“You really are bribable with food.”\n\nAs he walked away to another part of the park, Janne casually looked around. As she kicked some rocks and turned over some leaves, she noticed a local thrift shop was being delivered a portable power generator. It was the tenth one she noticed today around the park. She walked across the street and asked the store owner."
 CAL_IBI.3.a:0 "“I’ll be right back, DeeGee.”"
 
 CAL_IBI.4.t:0 "Residual Energy"
 CAL_IBI.4.d:0 "“What’s with the generator? I thought LA had reliable power.”\n\nThe owner turned to her as he directed his employees to install the generator, “We used to before the Kerfuffle and the shortages. But our problem was before even that. One evening, this surge took out power across half the city. Most places were restored quickly but everywhere in the five blocks around us has been having weird power issues since. Company says they’re still trying to fix it. Now we’re resorting to our own power.”\n\n“When did you say this happened?”\n\n“Huh, now that I think of it. It was around the time those girls at the park over there disappeared. Maybe whoever took them knocked over a power pole somewhere. Poor girls, they were even at my shop that very evening.”\n\nAs he walked away, Janna thought about what that meant. Hector walked over to her. “Found anything interesting, Janna?”\n\nShe rubbed her chin, “This neighborhood has been experiencing odd power loss.”\n\n“I told the City Council we needed to replace the lines. But no one believed the Mayor. Typical.”\n\n“Not that. They started having this problem when those St. James' girls disappeared. What could cause a power surge and leave residual power spikes?”\n\n“Lingering radiation could do that. Hmmm,” he turned to an agent across the street, “Get a geiger counter and a radioptic diffuser. I want to know if there's energy in this park and what it is!”\n\n“Yes Sir!”\n\nThe shop owner walked back to them."
 CAL_IBI.4.a:0 "“Mind if I mention something else?”"
 
 CAL_IBI.5.t:0 "The Paranormal Case"
 CAL_IBI.5.d:0 "“I didn’t bring it up when I learned they disappeared,” he said as he turned on his surveillance systems, “But I had footage of two of the girls at my shop the evening they disappeared. What’s her name, Anne I think.. I found footage of her stealing some box from my store.”\n\n“A box?” asked Janna as they watched the clip of Anne shoving the box into her backpack.\n\n“A Man from Oregon sold it to me. Really shifty fella with a red fez. I think it was a music box.”\n\nHector took another closer look at the box, “It looks like a frog on it?” Suddenly, a thought crossed his mind. He played it off, “Hmmm, we’ll keep that in mind. Thank you for the information.”\n\n“Of course, anything for our former Mayor and his daughter.”\n\nJanna interrupted, “I’m not his daughter.”\n\n“Whatever.”\n\nAs he walked out, Hector grabbed the tape with the footage and pulled Janna back outside, “I recognize that box. Here’s a question, Janna. You know of Project Golden Gate?”\n\n“Yeah, that portal Norton is building to give the finger to Star’s Mom and the MHC. What about it?”\n\n“Then you are aware of its massive energy usage, both in order to open a portal and when it radiates energy outward when a portal closes. Energy that we had to shield against or it can cause damage in the lab. Sound familiar?”\n\n“Wait... that box is a portal? They could be in another dimension!”\n\n“Anywhere in the multiverse... But I have an idea where,” Hector took out his phone and placed a call. It answered, “This is Hector. Meet me at 51 in an hour. You’ll want to see this.” He ended the call.\n\n“Who was that?” asked Janna."

 CAL_IBI.6.d:0 ""And if you look over here, you will see a series of giant medical vats. The government likes placing different creatures in here, from aliens, monsters, and occasionally communist dissidents. Now follow me to the next lab...”\n\nA lady in a black suit lingered behind the main tourist group going through the former secret base turned tourist attraction that was Area 51. As she looked at an attraction of worthless vats, a man with a bag of “Redacted” popcorn walked up to her.\n\n“This better be important, Diaz,” said Director Beth Amarin.\n\n“Amy, please. Have I ever let you down?”\n\nShe gave him a glare, “Call me Director Amarin, not your annoying nickname, Lieutenant Governor.” She turned her head away from him.\n\nHe rolled his eyes, “Well, it is important, Director. I know where the box is.”\n\nHer head snapped right at him, a momentary blue glow from her eyes before she grabbed hold of him, “Where is the Music Box!”\n\n“It WAS in California.” Hector pushed her off, “But the girls from the St James Disappearance found it first... Case solved.”\n\nAmarin backed off, suddenly horrified at what she just heard. She almost stumbled from the stanchions before standing back up to regain her composure. “I... I see.”\n\n“You have to do something.”\n\n“No.”\n\n“No? Director, it was you and Elin that told us how dangerous that box is. If Andrias has it, then...” he looked at her, confused, “Mobilize the FPI! Find the coordinates in Huckabone’s files. We must strike Amphibia first!”\n\n“No! The situation in the east is complicated. I, I, uh,” her voice pitched and broke, “W-we’re done here, Hector.”\n\n“What? Amy?”\n\nShe was already gone. Hector sighed."
 CAL_IBI.6.a:0 "“Damn it, this isn’t good...”"
 
 CAL_IBI.7.t:0 "Dealing with Past and Present"
 CAL_IBI.7.d:0 "“Hector?” He grabbed the secured satellite phone and walked away from a squad of rangers of the ‘President’s Coven’ who were conducting some magic sparring drills.\n\n“Andrew, this is critical. The Amphibian Music Box. It's back on Amphibia!”\n\n“What?! How do you know that?”\n\n“It’s a repeat of history. Those three girls that disappeared months ago. They found the box and went to Amphibia. For all we know now, King Andrias has that box.”\n\n“My God. Have you told Amarin?”\n\n“She didn’t take the news well. We can’t expect help from the FPI.”\n\n“Aigoo! Then...” Andrew walked over to a table and pulled out a series of maps of Oregon. On one map, he pointed at a position on the map. “Here. I’m sending you coordinates for a sit down.”\n\n“We’ll need more of a plan if we’re meeting behind our governments.”\n\n“I do. Bring whatever information you have on that box. We’re having a sit down...”"

 CAL_IBI.8.t:0 "Role Models"
 CAL_IBI.8.d:0 "At the Oregon-Nevada Border, a small dimensional tear opened up. Hector walked out from it into the northern desert around him. Quickly enough, the sound of a sonic boom and a bird squawk rang out as Andrew flew in on his staff, coming quickly coming to a stop in front of Hector.\n\nAndrew removed his aviation mask, “Hector.”\n\nHe responded with a mute tone, “Andrew.” He turned to the wooden parrot on Andrew’s witch staff, “Bujeog!”\n\nThe parrot morphed from wood to flesh and feather, “Squawk! Hello Hector! Squawk! Bujeog wants a cracker! Squawk!”\n\n“I’m sorry Bujeog. I forgot to bring you one-”\n\nThere was then a hard thump almost right next to them, dirt and sand kicking up over their head.. Both of them backed off and readied for battle; Hector morphed into his mewberty form, all six hands glowing in a magic aurora while Andrew drew up a massive energy ring and took aim with his staff. After a moment, the dust settled and a woman in a bright red aurora stood up from her landing stance.\n\nHer eyes glowing red, she slowly walked up to the very front of Andrew’s staff and turned to Bejeog. Her glow disappeared suddenly and she petted the bird, “I brought you a cracker!”\n\n“Squawk! Elin brought Bujeog food!”\n\nShe smiled and petted the palisman as Hector and Andrew stood down. She sighed and turned to them."
 CAL_IBI.8.a:0 "“Well. I’ll bite guys. What did you want from me?”"
 
 CAL_IBI.9.t:0 "Where False Legends Stand..."
 CAL_IBI.9.d:0 "“Andrian has the music box, Shroud,” said Hector.\n\nShe smiled and quietly chuckled to herself, “Right, right...”\n\n“Damn it Elin. Three girls found the box and were sent to Amphibia. Does that sound familiar?” asked Andrew.\n\nHector continued, “And don’t play coy with us. Using the Northwest Cover Up to invade Oregon. And you didn’t think I would notice agents I trained decades ago snooping around Los Angeles? You knew about this before anyone else!”\n\nShe baby talked with the palisman, “Who’s a good little palisman?”\n\n“Squawk! Bujeog is! Squawk!”\n\nElin turned to them, “And? I'm guessing you went to Amarin already. Need I ask how that went?”\n\n“No...” Hector pulled out a small flash drive from his coat and walked over to her, “Here.”\n\n“What is it?”\n\n“All the data I gathered on the box when it activated. We know you want to go back. So here. With the men you have, you’ll get coordinates soon enough.”\n\nElin took the drive. She turned to them, “Amazing... everything you two idiots do. Always a reaction!”\n\nAndrew took exception to that, “Excuse me?”\n\n“We warned you. I warned you! Whether it be fifty years or in a thousand years, this would happen. You two did what? You went off to play as a witch, leading a facisit coven and butchering a three hundred year old alliance between us and MI-13? You, who strolled about, aiding monsters, murdering monarchs because it was some family linage? For what? For Huckabone’s goal of stopping some triangle demon? Amarin and I watched on the side lines as you spread chaos across the multiverse, made it worse ‘fixing it’ then sealing up entire dimensions and pretending it never happened.” She turned back to the parrot palisman, “Amarin gave up... how convenient now that I didn’t.”\n\n“Elin...”\n\nShe began to walk away, “You’ll know when I succeed... when I’m gone. Then?” She turned back to them one last time, “You two can go back to trying to kill each other, as you always have.” She engaged her powers and with a light push upward, blasted off from the desert, leaving behind only a fading trail of red light behind her path.\n\nBujeog chirped."

 CAL_BIB_event.1.d:0 "Oregon Secretary of State Andrew turned to his watch, “He’s late...”\n\nA dimensional tear then appeared in his office in the middle of the night. Andrew laid back in his seat as a man emerged from the Mewni type of dimensional portal. Yawning to check the time once more, he almost paid no mind as Hector Diaz-Guzman, Lieutenant Governor of California, stepped out. He turned to Andrew.\n\n“Andrew,” he said in a panned tone.\n\n“Hector,” Andrew replied in the same tone.\n\nHector used his magical powers to lift the power switch, revealing Governor Milly Onxy and Colonel Parson Northwest in the room. “Really?"\n\n“They insisted.”\n\n“Of course...” Hector gave him a satellite phone, “We’ll use this for any further communication.”\n\n“FPI issued?”\n\n“Took it as part of my “severance package”. I doubt anyone knows they are missing or the line between them is still active.”\n\nAndrew gave the phone a look, “This will work.”\n\nMilly walked up to both of them, “You too seem far more amicable here than during the last NDR party convention.”\n\nHector chuckled, “Madam Governor. You saw my powers. And you know his,” he gestured to Andrew, “If we fought, well... I don’t want to explain to Norton or Pines why you two died in the crossfire.”\n\nAndrew scuffed, “He has that amount of professionalism, I'll give him that.”\n\n“Governor, Colonel,” As a portal opened up behind and he fell back into it, he gave Andrew the finger and disappeared.\n\nMilly and Parson turned back to Andrew. Leaning back in his seat, he drew a small circle with his finger, a small trail of light following his finger. A small ball of flame appeared and he held the flame in his palm.\n\n“You saw what California could very well wield against us.” said Andrew as he made the flame burn brighter, then puffed iit out in an instant, “So before we convene for the night...”"

Rafael was still wearing the suit of armor he put on there. He promptly fell to the ground after arriving home, quickly swarmed by the laser shooting puppies.\n\nStar turned to her wand, concerned about the missing half of the crystal embedded into it. But she quickly shrugged it off, “It was no sweat Marco.”\n\nThere was then a knock on the door. Before Marco could walk over, it burst open and a SWAT team rushed in. Right after them running in was the Lieutenant Governor of California. “Rafael, Angie, Marco!” he rushed over and embraced Marco and his mom as his dad struggled to get back up in his suit of armor. “Your father texted me what happened and I rushed over as soon as I could. How did you even get to Mew...” he noticed Star next to them, “Dios Mio...”\n\n“Hello!” Star introduced herself, “I’m Star Butterfly! I’m a princess from the magical world of Mewni!” She whispered to Marco, “Who’s the old man?”\n\n“Star, this is my great uncle Hector. He also happens to be Lieutenant Governor of California. That’s like the person right below the Queen back on Mewni.”\n\n“Oh!” she nodded, “And you said you were not royalty, Diaz Family.”\n\nHector turned back to Marco, “W-Why is the crown princess of Mewni here?”\n\nMarco took a moment to explain what had happened in the past few months. Hector sat down and gestured the SWAT team out of the house as he listened in shock. Unable to find the words to respond, Star and Marco took it as a casual acceptance and walked away to get ready for bed.\n\n“I did message you what was happening this whole time,” said Rafael as he stood back up.\n\n“I thought you were on one of your PEYOTE INDUCED ART DRUG TRIPS when you said all that!” he calmed himself down, “Dip down, Hector... I’m sorry, Raefel. I didn’t take you seriously. But Star and her kind are dangerous!”\n\nAngie countered, “Star is our hero! She risked her life to save my son, your grandnephew, from some evil lizard named... what was it? Laffy, Taffy?”\n\n“Toffee, Angie,” Hector replied, “You know what. I have been too busy with work.

 CAL_MILITARY.1.t:0 "A Quiet Retirement"
 CAL_MILITARY.1.d:0 "As he carried a cup of tea down the hallway, Sherman “Shermie” Pines looked at the old photos hanging on the wall. He looked on first at the photos of his grandchildren, including a recent image of them with Dipper’s brown cap and Mabel’s shooting star sweater. Next was of his own children, from a summer trip with them to Disneyland Pyeongyang in the 80s to Eugene Pines when he graduated from UC Emeryville to his daughter Emily Pines in her Marines formal Dress after she was promoted to Captain.\n\nFinally, he chuckled to himself looking at a poorly timed photo of him socking his brother Stanford Pines as Ford tried to hog the new born twins from him. But he stopped at the last photo on the wall. There laid a photo of him at the docks of Newark before his first deployment, playing around with both of his brothers, Stanford and Stanley Pines. He sighed and walked away.\n\nAs he sat down with his wife Angelica and turned to the TV where an ad of “Norton For Governor” was on, he received a call on his cell phone, which Angelica was playing Candy Smasher on. He took the phone back and answered it."
 CAL_MILITARY.1.a:0 "“This is Sherman Pines... Governor Green?!” "
 
 CAL_MILITARY.6.t:0 "Elevator Music"
 CAL_MILITARY.6.d:0 "“Wait, wait! Hold that door!”\n\nWearing his old and now tight formal uniform, Shermie rushed over to the elevator as a hand stuck out to hold the door. He rushed inside as it closed and took a moment to catch his breath.\n\n“Thanks for that...”\n\n“Of course. General Pines, I assume?” asked the other man in the elevator.\n\nShermie dusted himself, “Why yes,” he held his hand out to him, “General Sherman Filbrick Pines. Retired, but from how things are going, that may no longer be the case.\n\n“California could certainly use you,” he shook his hand, “Lieutenant Governor Hector Diaz-Guzman.”\n\n“Lieutenant Governor! It’s a pleasure to finally meet you in person. Will you be joining Governor Green and I?”\n\nHector smiled but shook his head, “I must attend to other matters. Still, it's good to meet you again, actually. You have certainly changed a lot from the young Lieutenant who was nervously awaiting to be pinned the Medal of Honor by Nixon.”\n\nShermie looked at him, thinking for a moment. He then remembered, mildly shocked, “Why yes, you were the one who offered me that cup of water! That was a long time ago.” Shermie gave him another look, “You certainly aged better?”\n\n“Perks of my old trade.”\n\n“And that was?”\n\nThe elevator opened up.\n\n“Perhaps another time, General Pines.”"

 CAL_MILITARY.7.t:0 "Recalled to Service"
 CAL_MILITARY.7.d:0 "“You want me to command the National Guard?”\n\n“Not just them,” said Governor Green in his office in Sacramento, “Several army officers and even the Marines at Fort Pendleton say they’ll stay in California instead of heading East if you assume control. Any hopes to protecting California and restoring the US rest on you returning to service.”\n\nWith Norton only days away from assuming control as the new Governor of California, the outgoing Gerald Green was making sure California was ready with some sane leadership. If war broke out, having Pines fighting for California can bring many military units to side with them and the Hero of Mesopotamia. Likewise, Shermie knew him in control of the military was equally for internal security as any external one.\n\n“I know you called me here over Norton, Governor Green.”\n\n“Norton, yes. But more so, my and soon his Lieutenant Governor, Hector Diaz-Guzman. Have you ever met the man before?” asked Green.\n\n“We talked on the elevator ride up here, actually. He remembered meeting me, right before Nixon pinned a medal on me. Not sure why he was there in the White House. I assumed he was Secret Service. Very young to be one at the time, though.”\n\n“He’s a former, hopefully, agent. I’m not sure which alphabet agency and I pulled every connection in Washington before and after the Kerfuffle. With his heavy clout in the South, I’m just as worried about him as this Emperor of ours. But still. We will all need you, General Pines. Do you accept?”\n\nHe thought about it, remembering he will now be facing off against Oregon, where his brother and grandchildren were.\n\n“I hope fighting doesn’t break out. Even in victory, we won’t win.”"

Yours’ a second time Adams.”\n\n“Copy that, Major.”\n\nThe three of them sneaked their way to the gangway on the cargo ship to the docks of San Diego below. As they stepped on dry land, a swarm of vehicles marked “I.B.I.” surrounded them as helicopters flew above head. Agents quickly stepped out and raised their weapons as their commander walked up to them.\n\n“Major Emily Pines. 4th Marine Engineering Battalion, am I correct,” asked Hector Diaz-Guzman.\n\n“That’s correct.” She said, hands raised, “We’re here to fight for California and General Pines!”\n\n“Oh don’t worry,” he waved his agents to stand down, “We caught word of that a few days ago,” Hector chuckled, “That’s some journey. I’d half expect you simply have your marines take control of the ship.”\n\n“My marines are best the Corps has to offer. We're engineers, not pirates. That’s what the Navy’s for.”\n\n“I don’t doubt you, Major. Come with me, your father has been awaiting you all week at Fort Pendleton. Your subordinates can work with my agents to get your men treated,” Hector grabbed something from the van and tossed it to Emily’s XOs, “This should keep them busy.”\n\n“Awesome, crayons!” said Charlie.\n\nEmily looked at Hector with annoyed disbelief."

We do however have access to private contractors we can hire to do the job.\n\nRight now, the two biggest we can choose is Northwest of California’s Mil-Tech, a US favorite, and Imperial Japan’s Arisaka thats based in Night City. Mil-Tech has plenty of former US soldiers, so integration with our troops is easier. But they take up more resource trains to supply. Arisaka troops are better trained, but our politicians don’t like foreign private mega-corps and they cost more. Likewise, our people hate both and view it highly hypocritical that California of all states would hire them.\n\nNow, we could secretly sign deals with both of them and weaken them both by pitting them against each other.

They even successfully integrated with the Canadian Pacific Flotilla after they escaped Canadian Okinawa when the Japanese Imperial Self-Defense Fleet took it back. Still, the situation in Asia is tense and the Admiralty made it clear to General Pines that if the Fleet leaves, our states from Chukotka to South Vietnam will quickly fall to Russian, SEATO, or former Commonwealth forces.\n\nStill, supplies are tight. Besides burning dirty fuel from reactivated refineries from Alaska, the fleet needs food and supplies, which we have. Keeping things unofficial, Admiral Park is willing to “look the other way” and let some ships go AWOL and sail for California. We would in turn send rations and ordinance.

Your uncle is here also. So I’m running security for this whole show,” Janna turned to two buff men in black that were near the catering table, “Hey, get back to work!” They quickly broke off and hurried back to their post.\n\nStar pondered, “So how is this Norton the ‘Emperor’ of your land?”\n\nJanna shrugged, “He basically announced it one day and we were, “That’s hilarious. Sure, why not.””\n\n“I swear, your world can be so weird sometimes.”\n\nAs they wondered, Hector was walking off the stage and noticed the three of them. As he walked up to them, Joshua Norton and his assistants happened to walk by and they all met right there.\n\n“Governor Norton.”\n\n“Lieutenant Governor Diaz. That was a fine speech.

She even curtsied, “Salutations, Emperor Joshua Norton. I am Princess Star Butterfly.”\n\nHector immediately laughed the whole thing off, not wanting to expose who she was, “She’s one of those foreign exchange students from Europe.”\n\nNorton spoke, shocked yet unsure why, “A Butterfly... your cheek marks. Young lady, you are from Mewni?”\n\n“Yes!

I, Crown Princess Star Butterfly of the Kingdom of Mewni, wish to formally invite you and your officials to an official state dinner with the Queen of Mewni!”\n\n“An invitation for dinner?” asked Everett.\n\n“From the Princess of Mewni?” asked Birnbaum.\n\n“With the Queen of Mewni, you say?” asked Norton, excited “My dear lady.

Archers at the balconies above took point, only to notice the red dots on their heads as Army Snipers took aim through the glass ceiling on the roof. One marine officer pulled out his own sword and tossed a Beowulf M-16 to Emily Pines, who quickly took aim at Rhombulus’s crystal head.\n\n“Bet your magic head scatters spectacularly from a .50 round,” said Emily.\n\n“Lady, you are ASKING for a crystalizing!” he said back to her.\n\nAt the front, Hekapoo had her shears readied, held only at saber point from Norton as Hector kept her in sight of his .223 pistol, “What are you doing here!”\n\n“I am the Emperor of the United States. And I was invited here!”\n\n“You have no right to come back to Mewni!”\n\n“I do not know who you are. I must be honest about how I even have knowledge of this land. But as a guest, I will not accept such treatment from your lot, and as leader of the most powerful nation on Earth, you can rest assured.

At the queen’s command, the Mewmans stood down and Norton quickly ordered his marines and soldiers to do the same. With the table in ruin and emotions still running high from a horrific experience, Star sighed in grief that her plan to pull a diplomatic gesture ended in disaster. For Moon’s part, she tried to salvage it.\n\n“This experience has proven to be... highly unfortunate for both sides.

He then stopped and whispered, “I’m sorry.”\n\nAfter a moment he noticed General Pines walk up to him, “This is an interesting set of paintings.”\n\nHector smiled at him, “Oh, yes.. I believe these are portraits of the past Queens of Mewni. Each one shows a glimpse of their personality and what they have done and accomplished in their lives.” They both stared at the one painting Hector was looking at for a bit, before he asked, “Tell me, Pines. Is this where we quickly draw our guns and you make your demand of what I know?”\n\nShermie chuckled, “Lieutenant Governor. I am too old of a man to match a drawing contest with you. I may be a fighter, but I was never really a soldier. A good one anyway. I was lucky, I lived, and I was rewarded for it.”\n\nHe nodded, “It does feel that way sometimes... but of course, your talents lay elsewhere,” there was the click of a hammer being pulled back from behind him, “Wouldn’t you agree with that assessment of your father, Major Pines.”\n\n“More or less,” she said as she held a gun behind him.\n\n“Well then?” asked Pines.\n\n“I was a former agent of the FPI, something I assume Green himself was trying to figure out? A long time ago, we learned about this place. A kingdom with princesses, magic and unicorns. This place was the very pinnacle of my career. And it saw the end of it as well.” He turned to Shermie, “I did not think I would ever come back here.”\n\n“And Norton? How does he know?”\n\n“That... is a greater mystery.

The Butterflies have already put their best minds to investigate the problem, but we fear they are not prepared to stop the ‘Frtiz’. The resulting magical declay are only minimal now, but if it continues it could soon affect their ability to even open dimensional tears.”\n\n“We can’t afford to lose contact with Mewni!” said Norton.\n\n“Nor the shipments of Magical Water...” Hector turned to some contacts on his phone, “We just might have to take this in our hands.”\n\nNorton nodded."

 CAL_norton_mind_event.2.t:0 "...And Breakdown"
 CAL_norton_mind_event.2.d:0 "“Could you tell me about them?”\n\n“Jushtin saved my life!” Norton chuckled. He sat up and continued regaling his therapist with the story, “And I saved him, oddly enough. I was being chased by this large monster from the forest. I had no idea how I got there. Right before it caught me, Jushtin and his ‘crew’ distracted the beast. It was then I realized I had a revolver, a truly foreign weapon on Mewni, and I joined the fight and drove it off with Colt fire. Impressed, he asked who I was. I didn’t even know my name, which was odd now that I think about it. But he noticed the suit I wore had the maker’s name on it and assumed it was mine. He read it out loud and from that moment they all called me Alphonse-”\n\nNorton stopped. He stood up and looked around as though he suddenly appeared in that room for the first time. He looked down on his formal coat with decorated medals and imperial decoration and he immediately removed the coat in disgust.\n\nThe Therapist spoke out, “Emperor Norton?”\n\n“Emperor?” his voice went from a old raspy tone to a clear, younger, more assertive tone, “You can’t honestly believe that dumb ad I posted in the papers?” He took a moment to recall the recent few months, “My god, I remember... I remember everything! My god they...” he sat down and took out the smartphone he was assigned, seeingly using it with ease where before he could barely comprehend such a device, “Lumeta! Get me a pair of damn decent clothes and order a squad of marines and rangers to travel with me to Mewni now!”\n\n“Joshua Norton?”\n\n“Those bastards!” He kicked the small coffee table aside, “They thought they could wipe my mind. And that wretched wrench Solaria! I gave her pathetic kingdom everything! I turned it into an empire! I replicated the industrial revolution in a year when it took humanity a century. I led her armies to victory over the monsters and THIS was what she repaid my service with? She and that confounded Commission! All they took from me when I gave them an Army! An Empire! a daught-”\n\nNorton fell to his knees and began crying. The therapist kneeled down to confront him as he struggled to speak.\n\n“They-they... they took my Eclipsa from me...”\n\nBack at the IBI facility, both Hector and Janna were shocked at what they heard."

 CAL_norton_mind_event.3.t:0 "Reina and Solaria"
 CAL_norton_mind_event.3.d:0 "Queen Solaria’s horseless carriage continued down through the Mewman waterway in the middle of the night. She needed to meet with the King of the Musty Kingdom to help negotiate a trade deal. Then she planned to take a detour, go down south and meet with the New Model Army currently in the underworld. As her driver wrestled with the control of the horseless carriage, she sighed and thought for a moment of him. She shook her head and focused on the treaty she carried with her.\n\nAs they passed a wooded area, gunfire opened up on her carriage and escort. Knights were picked off from their horses as Arquebus musket men rushed off the accompanying carriages and tried to form a firing line. It was then a horde of monsters rushed out from the wood and charged the line. As they battled, Solaria got out of her carriage and joined the fight to rally her soldiers. As they fought the monsters back, she noticed those who were firing at them from afar, she raised her hand and fired off several blasts to stop them. Realizing the darkness was making it hard to fight, she flew up and used her magic to create a source of light to illuminate the fog of war. Her soldiers inspired, they fought harder, recognized their firing line, and drove back the first wave of monsters.\n\nIt was then she saw who was using the same kind of weapons her army had. They looked like mewmans, wearing union blue uniforms. It was then she realized an artillery piece aimed right at her man. Before she could fire a blast, it opened fire. Its multiple barrels sung at high speed as it mowed down her guards with ease. The blast took out the gatling gun and the soldiers manning it, but then another swarm of monsters and blue coated mewmans, their Springfield rifles and bayonets at the ready, charged out the forest and routed her guards.\n\nShe flew back down and tried to rally them to her position. In the chaos, a small glass canister landed near her. She turned to it as it gave out an electric blast. She froze up for a moment, but regained her composure, raising her hand to destroy it. She then realized her magic was gone. Kicking the canister aside, she reached for her sword, her old wand sword having since been to her daughter Eclipsa, and she readied to battle. It was then she spotted a woman, wearing tan hide clothing, boots with spurs, and a cowboy hat. She drew her sword and instantly they clashed.\n\nThe battle was chaotic, but it was quick. Solaria fell to the ground and inched her way upright on a tree stump. As the monsters and the Union FPI Soldiers secured the perimeter, Reina walked up to the wounded Solaria. Solaria tried to blast Reina away, but she had no magic and grasped her wounds. Standing above her, Reina pulled out her revolver."
