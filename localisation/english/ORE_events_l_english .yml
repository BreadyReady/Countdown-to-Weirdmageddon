After a short meeting with the other governors in the west, Governor Onyx has declared that Oregon will reject D.C.'s authority and have declared along side Governor Day and Governor Green that the eastern goverment is no longer legitimate.\n\nAlready, the National Guard is being called up and with the pursuation of Colonel Northwest, a few US divisions in Oregon have agreed to side with us instead of heading East. Now, we must plan our next move."

 ORE_ELECTION_event.1.t:0 "The Eagle Has Landed!"
 ORE_ELECTION_event.1.d:0 "Four Years Earlier\n\n“-And so, if elected as your new governor, you can count on me to represent all Oregonian like yourselves across our great state!”\n\nThere was mild applause from the crown. But almost as loud was the whispers and murmurs of the town folk of Gravity Falls. Many were unsure of the woman on stage, former State Legislator Amelia Onyx, and her campaign to get their vote for Governor of Oregon.\n\n“I’m not so sure about her,” said Lazy Susan.\n\n“What’s her stance on supporting us small business folk?” said Bud Gleeful.\n\n“She could raise taxes! Then I’ll have to put more effort to commit tax fraud!” said Stan Pines.\n\n“I like her scarf!” said Old Man McGucket.\n\nBackstage behind the curtains, her campaign manager Andrew Chiu was distracted from what was going on upfront. Visiting Gravity Falls, he had taken to spend time with his granddaughter. He was playing pat-a-cake with the six-year-old Candy Chiu. It was then that Andrew’s personal pet, a talking parrot, squawked.\n\n“Squawk! She is bombing out there. Squawk!”\n\nAndrew turned to the curtains, “One moment, sweetie. Your hal-abeoji must do his job now. Watch Bujeog, would you please?”\n\nCandy held her arm out and spoke to the parrot, “Say something else, Bujeog.”\n\n“Squawk! Your grandfather was a secret government agent. Squawk!”\n\n“Hehe, silly bird.”\n\nAndrew poked his head out to see what was happening. As Onyx tried to rally the crowd, he noticed through the sun’s glimmer an eagle that was flying high above. He held up his hand behind him and drew a circle. A trail of light followed his finger and formed the circle, before disappearing. Then, the eagle above began to dive right towards the stage. The eagle stopped right in front of Onyx and began pecking at her. The crowd was amazed.\n\n“The Eagle! It chose her!” exclaimed Manly Dan.\n\n“She must be the new Governor. Cheers for our new Governor!” yelled Sheriff Blubs.\n\nAll the while, Onxy panicked as she tried to slap the bird away, “Ah! Andrew, get out here and get this bird off me!”"
