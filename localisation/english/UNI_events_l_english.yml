 UNI_intervention.1.d:0 "Trouble is brewing in the north. The [UFC.getname] and the [MAN.getname] are at each other’s throats, and war is all but guaranteed. This presents us with a unique opportunity, as if we were able to influence the winning side of the war we would be able to subjugate and put to work their muscle bound bodies. This would relieve us of our economic woes.\n\nHowever, we could also just observe the war as military research."

 UNI_intervention.1.b:0 "We shall simply observe"

 UNI_intervention.2.d:0 "The [UNI.getname] is offering to send us manpower for free. Although this may sound like a good deal, we don’t want to get too reliant on the unicorns. Getting too comfy with them may lead to subjugation..."

 UNI_intervention_confirmation.3.d:0 "The [FROM.getname] has declined our offer to subjugate them!"
 UNI_intervention_confirmation.3.a:0 "We’re gonna have to start preparing defenses..."

 UNI_intervention.3.t:0 "Help from the Unicorns: Equipment"
 UNI_intervention.3.d:0 "The [UNI.getname] is offering to send us equipment for free. Although this may sound like a good deal, we don’t want to get too reliant on the unicorns. Getting too comfy with them may lead to subjugation..."
 UNI_intervention.3.a:0 "We need this right now, we’ll take it!"
 UNI_intervention.3.b:0 "We don’t need this right now"

 UNI_intervention.4.t:0 "Help From the Unicorns: Field Advisors"
 UNI_intervention.4.d:0 "The [UNI.getname] is offering to send us field advisors and officers for free. Although this may sound like a good deal, we don’t want to get too reliant on the unicorns. Getting too comfy with them may lead to subjugation..."

 UNI_intervention.5.t:0 "Unicorns Demand our Subjugation!"
 UNI_intervention.5.d:0 "Due to us accepting a lot of aid from the Unicorns, they have obtained the audacity to tell us to become their subjects! Of course, we don’t want to give up our independence, but we have grown so reliant on the unicorns that we would suffer greatly if their aid was ripped from us."
 UNI_intervention.5.a:0 "We would lose a conflict with them, we have to comply..."
 UNI_intervention.5.b:0 "WE SHALL NEVER SURRENDER!"

 UNI_multi_mano_war_check.1.d:0 "The war has concluded. If we have sufficiently influenced the winner then we may subjugate them. If we haven't though, we will be at odds with them..."
 UNI_multi_mano_war_check.1.a:0 "Hm..."

 UNI_north_anarchy.1.t:0 "Rumors"
 UNI_north_anarchy.1.d:0 "There are some rumors going around about a human boy named Dipper going to assassinate a leader."
 UNI_north_anarchy.1.a:0 "Like some human can kill a manotaur or multibear..."
