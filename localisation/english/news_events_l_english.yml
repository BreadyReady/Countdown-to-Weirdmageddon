 before_news.1.d:0 "Yesterday in San Francisco, during an excavation to expand the BART Train Tunnels, a lost underground factory once owned by Ghirardelli was found. Inside was old 19th Century vats containing since rotted confections of the 1880s. However, during excavation, authorities found a near perfectly preserved man in a giant encasing of peanut brittle. Upon opening the peanut to retrieve the man, he has discovered to be alive and was successfully revived at Mark Bowman SF General Hospital.\n\nUpon questioning, it was discovered the man was local legend Joshua Norton, the self-proclaimed emperor of the United States. Many in the scientific community are amazed of his preservation while historians rushed to learn of the 19th century man."

 before_news.2.d:0 "Last night, President Adrian Curtis gave his State of the Union Address. In attendance was the congress of over 700 representatives and all 150 senators. In his opening remarks, Curtis attempted to bring unity, speaking of the American spirit and the common unity Americans have.\n\nHowever, it did not take long for him to turn to rhetoric. He stated how only his strong leadership can preserve the country, and spoke poorly of America’s Allies and dismissed talks of many oversea states wanting to leave the US. Quickly, he words sparked arguments in the audience and his speech ended early when fighting broke out.\n\nNew Polls leading into the election year place him at 43%."

 kerfuffle_news.1.d:0 "'It happened in the early morning. It felt like any other ordinary day. I was there at the border when it occurred. I had just crossed into the US for business and had stopped near the Peace Arc to take a picture to send to my kids. All at once, a thick fog rolled in from along the coastline. Thick, gray, unnerving, it rose as high as I could tilt my head to look up. Sunny and clear on the American side, just a wall of fog on the other side. My home and native land, my husband and children in Vancouver. They’re all gone...'\n\nOlivia Martin - Canadian Refugee\nFrom a recorded interview by the Washington State Guard"

 kerfuffle_news.2.d:0 "In the early morning hours across North America, a thick fog descended and consumed the entire nation of Canada. Right along the border between the continental US and Alaska, the entire nation was consumed by a thick fog nearly a mile high in the air. US President Curtis sat in the war room as his generals made it clear to him. Along with Norway as well in Europe, Canada, the leader of the Imperial Commonwealth, the US's largest trading partner, was gone.\n\nThe lost of Canada would have grave implications for world diplomacy, having been the balance between the two superpowers of the United States and the European Union. But new reports internally spell a worrying image. Americans are panicking. Are we next?"

Right along the border between the continental US and Alaska, the entire nation was consumed by a thick fog nearly a mile high in the air. Residence on Vancouver Island looked on as the fog seemingly avoided their island and descended on the mainland, devouring it whole.\n\nThe People rushed to get online, make phone calls, or send radio transmissions to the mainland, but the lines were dead, nothing came back. As the Premier of British Columbia took charge to calm people down and sent scout teams to investigate, it dawned on him that he was likely the highest ranking Canadian left. His city and the island were all that was left of Canada."

 kerfuffle_news.3.d:0 "Despite inconclusive reports of what caused the Canadian Kerfuffle, Curtis had announced to the League of Nations that the European Union caused the Kerfuffle! Seeing to inspire patriotism in a pacifist America, he dismissed the 'cowardly' congress with Chief Justice Norman’s help and called on the US to rally for war. Though the EU had also been given similar reports, they reacted in turn by blaming the 'Imperialist' Americans for stealing Norway and began preparation for war as well.\nMany across the US are shocked at the news as the Army and Navy are called up to head to the East Coast to prepare for war. With congress gone, governors west of the Mississippi River have denounced President Curtis as a madman."

 kerfuffle_news.4.d:0 "Today, the great 75-Star Union has all but fallen apart. The governors of Oregon, Washington, and California are now meeting to rally the Western US and loyal military forces against President Curtis. The now independent Texas have annexed its neighboring states to protect its new independence from Federal Forces. The admirals of the US Pacific Fleets refused orders from DC to return home and instead instituted martial law in America's Oriental States. In Europe, the State of Ireland had revolted from American rule and the State of Levant was blockaded by the EU Mediterranean Fleet. All the while, President Curtis have cemented his power east of the Mississippi, determined to crush the Euros and the traitors.\n                                The Long Summer had begun"

 west_election_news.1.d:0 "In the morning hours yesterday, a man claiming to be the President of the United States rode backwards on horsebacks through the streets of Portland before his horse jumped over the Burmside Bridge and fell into the Willamette River. Disrupting a high-level meeting between the governors of Oregon, California, Washington, Alaska, and Hawaii, Governor Onyx has announced that the man, who called himself Sir Lord Quentin Trembley III, Esq., is in fact the former and original 9th President of the United States.\n\nHe was in suspended animation in peanut brittle, similar to California's Joshua Norton. With this revelation, many wonder how this will affect the Western US’s response to President Curtis’ Coup."

Declaring himself the rightful leader of the United States, he called on the states to rally behind him while ordering the Eastern US government to stand down. From Portland to Gravity Falls, people cheered on as Trembley was sworn in by the Chief Justice of Oregon as the 46th President of the United States while the new congress, consisting currently of new representitives from Oregon and Idaho, offically reinstated his former title of the true 9th President. With him, Governor Onyx and State Secretary Chiu were sworn in as his Vice President and Secretary of State, respectivley. No word yet of reaction from the Eastern Government, Washington, or California."

 west_election_news.3.d:0 "In an electoral upset, Joshua Norton has won the election for the Governorship of California. The self-proclaimed "Emperor" of the Unites States entered the race just weeks left with the intent to stop the "Rogue" Lord Trembley. Frighten by the Kerfuffle and Oregon's Trembley, Californians voted for him with an overall 58-point lead over San Francisco Mayor Travis Olson. Already, the office of Lieutenant Governor Hector Diaz-Guzman has issued a generic message of congratulations and support for the new governor. But while many SoCal legislators have expressed concerns, their NorCal counterparts have all but sworn fidelity to Norton. One thing is certain; the world watches if this new Imperial California Republic can save the United States."
