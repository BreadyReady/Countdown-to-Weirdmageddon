 TSR_palace.1.t:0 "By the Lamp's Grace"
 TSR_palace.1.d:0 "Three o’clock had come and past. The Crowd outside the gates of the Tsar’s Palace in Mothscow.\n\n“Where is the Tsar?! He promised us a time and not a second later!” yelled one peasant.\n\n“He doesn’t view our time as valuable as a Mewman. He said so himself,” insinuated another.\n\nNot even a single second past the promised time would be tolerated, and as the first minute went by, the crowd’s frustration, already at its height but bottled up before three o’clock, was now being let out all at once. In the commotion of angry peasants yelling, a rumor spread that military forces were entering the city proper and advancing on the palace. Five minutes in and the crowd was united on the idea of storming the palace outright.\n\nAs the crowd slowly advanced closer, the Lampist Patriarch Barth Gesenkiye fought through the crowd and reached the front. A disciple of his placed a wooden box at the feet of the gate for the short moth patriarch to stand on. He took to his small stage and called out to the crowd.\n\n“My children, children of the lamp. I beckon you all to settle down and avoid rash action-!”\n\n“Get out of the way, Patriarch! Our dealings are not with you!” said someone up front.\n\n“If not the Tsar, appointed by the Lamp, then surely you’ll listen to a man who serves the Lamp, no?”\n\nThe crowd quieted just enough for him to speak. He spoke for a short few minutes and, by some divine might, the crowd settled down. As he stepped down from his crate, he turned up and past the gate to the balcony, where he saw a mewman staring out the window. He looked right at the Patriarch as well, then walked away towards the Tsarina. Gesenkiye turned to his disciple."
