 GNM_flavor.1.t:0 "Vacant Throne"
 GNM_flavor.1.d:0 "Our situation as a nation and people is precarious. For the past several months, the throne of our dear Realm of Gnomes has laid vacant and cold, its vacancy slashing across the spirit and soul of our nation like a butcher's knife. Or more like the slash of a badger, because it was due to a freak badger attack that our queen has passed from this world, and many in the kingdom were left in a state of shock and confusion. Ever since, our people from all over the realm have been in search of a new queen, a new successor to the throne who would project our beauty and magnificence upon this world without having to actually look at the people behind the throne! This brings us to our current dire issue...\n\nEvery female gnome in this country is absolutely hideous!\n\nHow are we supposed to look good to all of the world if our queen herself looks like the dung of a deer was smeared all over her face, and then was blasted with the flames of a furnace!? We cannot, I tell you! We would be the mockery to every nation around us, the queen only projecting the ugly and sad state of affairs our realm finds itself in! We must find a true queen, a beautiful and smart individual who can lead our nation through these dire and troubling times! We must turn our gaze outwards into the world beyond our borders...\n\nAnd we can only hope we find the queen soon, some are starting to lose hope..."

 GNM_flavor.2.t:0 "The Perfect Candidate"
 GNM_flavor.2.d:0 "Jeff Little Legs looked over the table before him. It was covered in documents, pictures, and the like. Sitting on the sides of the table were some of his gnome advisors. "Well then it's decided." Jeff said, his eyes lingering on a picture. "Mabel Pines will be our Queen!"\n\nThe Gnomes around him looked at each other and nodded in agreement, quietly rumbling in agreement.\n\n"Of course, she would never hear us out as gnomes. But, I've got a plan!" He pulled out a rolled up piece of paper and unfurled it on the table. "Feast your eyes on this!"\n\nOn the paper was a diagram of a hooded figure, about the size of a teenage human. It wasn't human, however, as the diagram showed it was just 5 gnomes stacked on top of each other.\n\n"We'll disguise ourselves as a human, then reveal our true nature when she's fallen in love! It's flawless I tell ya, flawless!""
 GNM_flavor.2.a:0 ""I even know what we'll name ourselves: Norman!""

 GNM_queen_hunting.1.t:0 "Preparation"
 GNM_queen_hunting.1.d:0 "Jeff Little Legs stood proudly as the head of Norman. At the height of a human, we could see farther in the forest than he could ever see before. Below him were two gnomes that acted as hands, and below them were gnomes that acted as legs. To the left, right, and above, scaffolding was built so that other gnomes could drop the black hoodie they found in the abandoned church onto Norman.\n\nJeff looked up as the gnomes carried the hoodie above him. "Left... left... right... right... Ok fellas why the heck are you bringing it forwards-" They let go of the hoodie, and it messily dropped on Jeff's head.\n\nAfter about 20 minutes of struggling, they managed to properly get the hoodie on. Slowly, Norman put one foot in front of the other and looked at himself in a mirror. \n\n"Well, other than my hair, this is great! We'll be having a Queen in no time!" Jeff lauded his team as he admired Norman's Human-ness.\n\n"Thanks boss!"\n\n"No problem boss!"\n\n"Shmebulock."\n\n"Now onwards! To, uhh... Your new queen!" Norman slowly trudged along a forest trail, crossing a sign that said TO GRAVITY FALLS."

 GNM_queen_hunting.2.t:0 "New Candidate"
 GNM_queen_hunting.2.d:0 "The Gnomes were gathered around the planning table yet again. It was a new table, as they had burned the old table for fear that it brought bad luck.\n\n"Ok fellas, I know we haven't had the best of luck, but..." Jeff Little Legs pulled out a rolled up piece of paper and unfurled it onto the table. "Ta-da! New Candidate, what d'ya think?"\n\nThe gnomes looked at the paper, climbing on top of each other to get a better look. It was a document on a human girl named Candy Chiu.\n\n"Looks great!"\n\n"'Calm Voice?' She'll make a perfect Queen!"\n\n"I know, right?" Jeff said. "Now, we'll have to take a new approach to this. Our last strategy was too much time and too much risk. So I've come up with a new plan." He put an elbow on the table and raised an eyebrow. "We'll kidnap them and bring them to the forest. We can ask them to be queen quickly. No dilly-dallying!"\n\nThe gnomes looked at him in silence, thinking about the plan. Finally, one gnome spoke up. "What if they decline? At least with the last girl we tried to sway her beforehand."\n\n"You see, that's where the preparation phase comes in. We'll build a psychological profile of Candy by spying and infiltrating. Once that's done, we'll put together an argument that'll subconsciously appeal to her!""

New Candidate, what d'ya think?"\n\nThe gnomes looked at the paper, climbing on top of each other to get a better look. It was a document on a human girl named Pacifica Northwest.\n\n"Looks great!"\n\n"'Member of the Northwest Family?' She'll make a perfect Queen!"\n\n"I know, right?" Jeff said.

 GNM_queen_hunting.5.t.1:0 "Operation Everything nice"
 GNM_queen_hunting.5.d.1:0 "Candy opened her eyes as the sack on her head was taken off and her restraints untied. There was a little bit of dirt on her face. She slowly looked around, and found herself in a forest. Surrounded by gnomes. They had carried her in, tied up on a log.\n\nOne of said gnomes stepped forward. "H- hi..." He awkwardly waved his hand. "My name is Jeff Little Legs."\n\n"Hello cute little talking garden decor.\n\n"'Cute?' Ha ha... Th- thank you!" Jeff blushed. "Uhm... so...\n\n"PWEASE BE OUR QUEEN!" A gnome scuttled out from a bush and hugged Candy's leg, crying. "WE WORKED SO HARD TO GET YOU HERE!"\n\n"Uhm, Queen?" Candy looked around. "Is that why you guys brought me here?"\n\n"PWEAS-"\n\n"Bad Steve, bad!" Jeff pulled out a spray bottle and sprayed it at him. Steve crawled back into the bush, whimpering.\n\nCandy raised an eyebrow. "What was that about me being a Queen?"\n\n"Ah, yes. Don't worry Ms. Chiu, we have a presentation that'll knock your socks off! It'll take 15 minutes, please hear us out!"\n\n"Hm, alright. And please...""
 GNM_queen_hunting.5.a.1:0 ""...Call me Candy.""
 
 GNM_queen_hunting.5.t.2:0 "Operation Northern Dream"
 GNM_queen_hunting.5.d.2:0 "Pacifica gasped for air as the sack on her head was taken off. There was a little bit of dirt on her face, she was tied up. She rapidly looked around, and found herself in a forest. Surrounded by gnomes. They had carried her in, tied up on a log.\n\nOne of said gnomes stepped forward. "H- hi..." He awkwardly waved his hand. "My name is Jeff Little Le-"\n\n"What the heck is going on!?" Pacifica struggled against the rope around her wrists. "Let me go, you pieces of garden decoration!"\n\n"Uhm, well... Ok! Guys, untie her!" The gnomes gathered around her and untied her. "But Pacifica, please hear us out!" Jeff put on some glasses and took out his slideshow clicker. A projector shined onto some stretched animal skin, acting as a display.\n\n"What the heck is this...?" Pacifica rubbed her wrists. "And for the record, your guy's hands are weirdly warm. Bleh."\n\nJeff clicked the clicker and started the slideshow. "We are the gnomes, we live in the forest and-"\n\n"How long is this freak show gonna take?"\n\n"What? Um, about 15 minutes. M'lady."\n\n"First off, never call me 'M'lady' ever again. Secondly, get me a real chair. I don't wanna sit on this dirty log and have a bunch of bugs crawl up my pants."\n\n"Of course, M'... woman?"\n\n"That's worse!"\n\n"A- Sorry! Pacifica!"\n\n"We're not on a first name basis, Mr. Gnome person." She crossed her arms.\n\n"Ok, Ms. Northwest. Guys, get her a chair!" A couple gnomes scurried off. "So, Ms. Northwest... does this mean you'll hear us out?""
 GNM_queen_hunting.5.a.2:0 ""...I'll humor you.""
 
 GNM_queen_hunting.6.t.1:0 "Operation Everything Nice 2"
 GNM_queen_hunting.6.d.1:0 "Jeff went on to give his presentation to Candy. Basic information about gnomes, their lack of a queen, the benefits that come from queenhood, their current situation, and a lot of emphasis on how the Gnomes could improve from Candy's leadership.\n\n"Hm, you're right, you guys have a lot of potential..." Candy adjusted her glasses. "Plus, it would be cool to have a big workforce. I could hand you guys my homework and stuff."\n\n"So we have a deal?" Jeff's eyes lit up.\n\n"Mm, okie." She held out her hand for a shake. Jeff took it.\n\n"You aren't gonna regret this, Candy!"\n\n"I won't, but you will!" She tilted her head to the side and smiled, closing her eyes.\n\n"Wait, what do you mean?""
 GNM_queen_hunting.6.a.1:0 ""I'm gonna work you guys to the bone!""

"Plus, it would be good to get some experience leading a team. I'm gonna inherit the Northwest Company, after all."\n\n"So we have a deal?" Jeff's eyes lit up.\n\n"...Sure." She reluctantly held out her hand for a shake. Jeff took it.\n\n"You aren't gonna regret this, Ms. Northwest!"\n\n"I'm sure I won't." She stood up from her chair. "Now, first order of business, get a real chair for me to sit on and not some moldy plastic folding one.""
