 EUS_anti_military:0 "Anti-Militaristic America"
 EUS_anti_military_desc:0 "America entered the 1990s as the sole dominant power on Earth. By the 2000s, disaster after disaster meant Americans lost any appetite for warfare or general care for the military. Low recruitment, budget, war support, and a renewed peace with the Union and Commonwealth is a major problem, as far as President Curtis is concerned."

 EUS_center:0 "The Center Of The Multiiverse"
 EUS_center_desc:0 "President Curtis and many Americans think that the United States is the center of the Universe. For those in the know, the Unites States of America feels like the center of the Multiverse itself! For them, thats a very bad thing."
 
 EUS_NDR:0 "The New Democratic-Republican Party"
 EUS_NDR_desc:0 "The NDR was a temporary coalition of the two main american parties during the early 2000s to fight back againts rising third parties. Though that threat ended quickly, the party leaders never broke the alliance inorder to consolidate power. Now, they are the single main party in the US, full of consituents they hate each other, but are unwilling to simply join another party."
 
 EUS_SDI:0 "The Strategic Defense Initiative"
 EUS_SDI_desc:0 "Completed in 1989, the dubbed "Star Wars" project was a complete success. Ending the possibility of Nuclear War, it was the final victory that ended the Soviet Union and the Cold War. What many failed to account was it ended the MAD Doctrine and allowed America to hold the world hostage with assymetic nuclear warfare. By the 2010s, the EU and IC developed their own version. True, Total Conventional Warfare is a viable option once again."
