We must integreate these monsters into Mewman culture so that we may govern them with better understanding, and  also so that eventually the monsters will be outbred by Mewmans overtime. And as we Mewmans are civilized rulers, we cannot use violence to further this goal. (And also using violence in this sort of thing usually backfires)\n\n§YNumber of Monsters Adopting Mewman Culture:§! [?monster_culture] Hundred Thousand"
