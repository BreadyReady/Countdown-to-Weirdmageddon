 CAL_STARTER.2.d:0 "With news of the dissolve of congress, followed by an uncermonial return of California's nearly 75 representives and two senators, Governor Green has called an emergency meeting in Portland. As National Guard forces are called up, Green annouced that, in cooridnation with Oregon and Washington, that the western US will no longer acknowledge D.C. and the Curtis Adminstartion as the legitmate Federal Government.\n\nAlready, US forces in the state have sworn loyalty to California as word now spreads that Green has asked the retired General Sherman Pines, the Hero of Mesopotamia, to take command of the state's military. Time will tell how this near esculation to civil war will lead."

 CAL_TWOWORLDS.1.t:0 "Two Worlds Collide" 
 CAL_TWOWORLDS.1.d:0 "Docked at Port Festiva, the naval transport ship USS Golden was offloading a new shipment of supplies bound for central Mewni. As the mewman dock workers scurried about, two Californians stood at the side of the ship near the bridge, looking down below where the wooden docks met the metal hull. Lady Everette, a former US Senator before the collapse of the US and now holding the title of Lady as she served as Norton’s Secretary of State, smirked, "Look at them. Uneducated peasants."\n\n"An unfair assessment, Lady Everette," said recently titled Lord Birnbaum, the CEO of Northwest of California, "That is why we are here. To bring them our help and assistance."\n\n"We are here, Birnbaum, only as traders because of the infinite grace of the Emperor!"\n\n"That and because both the State Assembly and the people support our help to the mewmans," Birnbaum pointed out.\n\n"The ‘Mewmans’ are a backward people. They have ‘magic’ and ‘interdimensional travel’, yet they still use hand cranked cranes and horse drawn carriages. They live in squalor, unlike us Californians!"\n\n"Norton only recently addressed the homeless crisis, you know."\n\n"And by his grace we should do the same of them," she held her hand out at a dock worker who was slowly walking backward from another worker, "Not with token aid, but by our armed forces! Just as we will one day bring liberation to America over the madman Curtis and the rogue Lord Trembley, we shall do the same to Mewni. Our ideals, our prosperity, our democracy, by the grace of Norton!"\n\n"And by the Imperial Governor’s grace, he knows the reality of our situation with Mewni, unlike you dear Lady. As much as they need our industry and food, we need their magical water, their knowledge of magic. That is the only thing keeping California afloat as the rest of the United States burns. They control our interdimensional communications and our ability to traverse dimensions. We lose that and California shall fall too! We are at each other’s mercy, Lady Everette. The first to pull the trigger would simply be the one responsible for both our deaths."\n\nShe rolled her eyes, "For now, Lord Birnbaum. But soon, with Project Golden Gate, all of the multiverse shall be at our beck and call."\n\nBirnbaum shook his head as she walked away."

 CAL_TREMBLEY.1.d:0 "We're getting word of some unnusual events up north near the oregon border. With Green visiting Portland, we need to make sure whatever is happening won't endanger the Governor! Already, the Liuentenant Governor has taken lead, oddly more concern about the mysterious figuers lurking near Medford, Oregon."

Already, we saw movement of the Oregon National Guard to counter them and we now fear fighting might break out. If this agency that we have learned is known as the Federal Paranormal Investigations continues to expand its occupation, they might spill into California and we could suddenly face a full war!"

 CAL_birnbaum_event.1.t:0 "Utah Joines the Imperial Republic!"
 CAL_birnbaum_event.1.d:0 "As we finish up negotiations with the State of Utah to join our Imperial United States, the governor of Utah has revealed that they have access to a special well with holy properties. To our amazement, the Great Salt Lake is home to an inter-dimensional well to the Realm of Magic, a special interconnecting dimension to everywhere else in our plan of reality! More importantly, it gives us access to that rare Magical Water, normally found only on Mewni.\n\nA deal has been proposed, separate of the main negotiations. If we invest into Utah, they’ll be willing to let us trade for it. But if we invest a large amount of capital both financial and political right now, they’ll exclusivity sell to us. We need access to the water for sure, but should we secure it now or worry of trade later?"
 CAL_birnbaum_event.1.a:0 "They have a Deal!"
 CAL_birnbaum_event.1.b:0 "Just make sure we can come back to this later..."
 
 CAL_birnbaum_event.2.t:0 "Arizona Joines the Imperial Republic!"
 CAL_birnbaum_event.2.d:0 "Arizona is asking the Imperial Government for help. There is currently a migrant crisis at the border with Mexico. We had assume its those fleeing South America in the wake of the now global kerfuffle, but that part of the world has been unusually stable and quiet.\n\nActually, we have no idea what’s happening in South America.\n\nThe people trying to cross over are actually Americans from the East Coast, fleeing President Curtis!\n\nOddly enough, none of them wanted to flee to California’s relativity open border, choosing Arizona instead. Arizona now ask we take custody of them and house them in California. But since Curtis won the Eastern States by a massive margin last election, many Californians are not so charitable to their eastern brethren. Arizona does promise close cooperation with the Imperial Government if we help, and the opposite if they don’t."
 CAL_birnbaum_event.2.a:0 "Send them to California"
 CAL_birnbaum_event.2.b:0 "Sends some fund to keep them in Arizona"
 
 CAL_birnbaum_event.3.t:0 "Colorado Joines the Imperial Republic!"
 CAL_birnbaum_event.3.d:0 "With the Rocky Mountain cutting right through the middle of the state, Colorado is both the Gateway to the West and a fortress anyone east must take to enter it. With potentially hostile states from the Eastern Government and the Trembley Government bordering it, Colorado is asking California to defend the front line of a divided America.\n\nWe can invest resources to fortify the state, with the goal of eventually using it as a staging ground to one day march East towards the Mississippi. While popular, that would be expensive. We could just set up some light defenses, but neither our or their populace will like this."
 CAL_birnbaum_event.3.a:0 "Like Hannibal before, Norton will one day ride down these Alps of America!"
 CAL_birnbaum_event.3.b:0 "Just shore up some defenses there."
 
 CAL_birnbaum_event.4.t:0 "New Mexico Joines the Imperial Republic!"
 CAL_birnbaum_event.4.d:0 "New Mexico is home to the original site of Los Alamos, where the first atomic bomb was developed. As SDI, EuroNet, and the Northern Lights systems render nuclear warfare as a whole impossible (on Earth), the site is still an active facility into both peaceful and non-peaceful research into the atom. One we could make good use of, in case something in the multiverse needs a nuke up the butt. Someone also mentioned Roswell and aliens, but Lieutenant Governor Diaz-Guzman laughed it off, citing the teenage alien joyriders that crashed there are either long dead or too high up in the old Federal Government to be touched.\n\nFor a lump sum payment, New Mexico will gladly hand the facilities to the Imperial Government and even wave the cost they incurred keeping it from irradiating the entire South West. We could also just take it, as we are the successor government to the old Federal Government, but they won’t be happy about that and the scientist will be less enthusiastic to work for us."
 CAL_birnbaum_event.4.a:0 "A fair enough deal."
 CAL_birnbaum_event.4.b:0 "Give us back rightful Imperial Property!"
 
 CAL_birnbaum_event.5.t:0 "Protector Of Mexico"
 CAL_birnbaum_event.5.d:0 "Similar to Arizona, there has been a refugee crisis of Eastern Americans heading to Mexico by sailing from Florida, then traveling up to the border. Apparently the Texan-Federal Border is that well guarded. This has cause major issues with the independent Republic of Texas and the United Mexican States. We can’t risk a war occurring in the Southwest when we need troops either in the Northwest or Mewni, so we have offered to intervene. With it, Emperor Norton has declared he will reinstate is old title of “The Protector of Mexico”, one he initially relinquished after France invaded Mexico centuries ago.\n\nThe Texans are not friendly to us Californians, but they are a rational folk. We can send Birnbaum in to use Northwest of Texas to open negotiations and find a solution to this crisis. Or we can outright demand they back off, as the might of California and its allied states can take on Texas.\n\nSome politicians think this is a bad mistake all around, but if we back off now, we will look weak to the entire country and disgrace Norton a second time around!"
 CAL_birnbaum_event.5.a:0 "California Bows to No One!"
 CAL_birnbaum_event.5.b:0 "Send Birnbaum In!"
 CAL_birnbaum_event.5.c:0 "We can't help..."
 
 CAL_birnbaum_event.6.t:0 "Let's Make a Deal!"
 CAL_birnbaum_event.6.d:0 "A deal from Texan President and (former actor) Peter McCalloughs has arrived. What we received was something even we were not prepared for.\n\nThe Texans are not faring as well as California since the collapse of interstate commerce and the Rockwell Pipeline moving liquid spore from Canada dried up at the start of the Kerfuffle. Worse, most of their funding has gone to militarization to protect itself and the buffer states it controls from President Curtis. All in all, they did a good job hiding their economic woes. Better we have for our own economy.\n\nThe deal is simple. If we foot the bill for American refugees, and invest greatly into the Texan economy through Northwest of Texas, they will agree to join the republic outright! Still easier said than done as the cost for this has been calculated and it is enormous. But if we, California, get Texas to join us, it would be a massive blow to Curtis and Trembley.\n\nWe also may not have a choice to this potential good fortune. A War with Mexico is almost imminent and if we fail to reach a deal quickly, or worse backtrack from this entire deal, we can face conflict with either nation.\n\nSo, what do we do?"
 CAL_birnbaum_event.6.a:0 "Accept the Deal"
 CAL_birnbaum_event.6.b:0 "Renegotiate Better Terms"
 CAL_birnbaum_event.6.c:0 "We Refuse!"
 CAL_birnbaum_event.6.e:0 "We're over our head on this..."
 
 CAL_birnbaum_event.7.t:0 "The Price of the Imperial Republic"
 CAL_birnbaum_event.7.d:0 "Politicians in both Sacramento and the Imperial Congress balk at the massive price tag of bringing Texas into the Imperial Union. It's debatable if Texas has even outsmarted California to its own benefit. But the peace we have won is of far greater value and never have we been this close to showing the world we are the new America. In a way, we are from Sea to Shining Sea. And that's worth any pretty penny (or trillion) to have!"
 CAL_birnbaum_event.7.a:0 "This is the price for a united America!"
 
 CAL_birnbaum_event.8.t:0 "No Deal"
 CAL_birnbaum_event.8.d:0 "Negotiations has collapsed! Already, troops are enmassing at the border of both new and old Mexico. It looks like we will have to pay for Texas's submission with blood."
 CAL_birnbaum_event.8.a:0 "One more obstacle to Unity!"
 
 CAL_birnbaum_event.9.t:0 "Betrayal on the Rio Grande"
 CAL_birnbaum_event.9.d:0 "Our backout from the negotations has stunned the Western US. Already, many are angry that Norton has failed to live to his title and now it seems it is Mexico itself that is angered by this."
 CAL_birnbaum_event.9.a:0 "Rush troops to the border, quick!"
 
 CAL_birnbaum_event.10.t:0 "A Fair Deal"
 CAL_birnbaum_event.10.d:0 ""The price is high, yes. But this is far more appetible than the first offer," said Lord Birnbuam. He pulled out a handkerchief and wiped his bald head, "This will be our last chance to seal the deal.""
 CAL_birnbaum_event.10.a:0 "Fine, we accept"
 CAL_birnbaum_event.10.b:0 "To Heck with all this!"

 CAL_birnbaum_event.11.t:0 "California Prevails!"
 CAL_birnbaum_event.11.d:0 "With the overwhelming pressure we place on Texas to back off and the potential war they face with both us and Mexico, Texas has surrendered. It's a bit surprising this even happened, but the point stands. If even Texas can't stand up to us, then who else in the old US can really have a chance to stop California and the Emperor?"
 CAL_birnbaum_event.11.a:0 "The Emperor Protects!"

 CAL_NWB.1.d:0 "REC has defaulted, causing a collapse of the mewni economy. While our economy is overall insulated from them, a ruined Mewni means we will lose critical reosurce like Mewni Magical Water and their Magic Research! Right now, Governor Norton and Lt. Governor Guzman are debating on what to do. Norton contemplates as Guzman makes a phone call. Shall we forgive the debt and restore the economy for Mewni? Can we, California, the richest state in the Union, with a GDP nearly eqaul to the half of the entire Imperial Commonwealth, only outclassed by the European superpowers of Franco-Germany or Polish-Lithuania, spare the $650 needed to bail Mewni of its debt?"

Already, the young Marco's granduncle, Regent Lieutenant Governor Hector Diaz-Guzman, is rallying forces loyal to him to overthrow the Imperial Governor and word is spreading this Lord President Trembley will side with them. But many still stand with Emperor Norton.\n\nWith most of our army still with us, camping in the Diaz's backyard, we have a choice. Stay with Southern California and hope one day Diaz and Trembley would help us reclaim our land? Or side with Norton, who is unlikley to win but eager to help us reclaim Mewni as soon as possible?"

 CAL_CEF.0.t:0 "The Mewmans Request Economic Aid"
 CAL_CEF.0.d:0 "The Kingdom of Mewni, the extradimensional kingdom we have made contact with, has requested that we send them some economic aid. Apparently they are going through some sort of food shortage, and due to them being an agrarian pre-industrial society, this spells disaster for them.\n\nAs we our looking for somewhere on Mewni to set up a more perment presence, if we were to send them aid, we would ask for some territory in return to "safeguard on their behalf". This would make us an interdimensional state, the first of it's kind coming from Earth and it'll serve as a massive prestige boost back home.\n\nOn the other hand, if we were to reject them and withhold aid, our analysts predict that the Kingdom of Mewni would not completely collapse just yet. It would go through some instability and hardship, sure, but the Butterfly Monarchy would stay in power, making the internal political pressure for humanitarian aid low in the future."

To this end, the territory of the Waterway Overlook was choosen by them for their inital spot, as its a unimportant location to us.\n\nBy accepting and taking their aid, we can be more lax on the people and accelerate out industrial development. However, by giving the Californians a foothold in our dimension it opens the door for them to exert more influence over the dimension and, by extension, us. With their industrial and technological advantage over us, we would be at a disadvantage when dealing with them. Should we ever get on their bad side..."
