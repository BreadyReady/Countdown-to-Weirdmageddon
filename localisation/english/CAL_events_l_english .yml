As National Guard forces are called up, Green annouced that, in cooridnation with Oregon and Washington, that the western US will no longer acknowledge D.C. and the Curtis Adminstartion as the legitmate Federal Government.\n\nAlready, US forces in the state have sworn loyalty to California as word now spreads that Green has asked the retired General Sherman Pines, the Hero of Mesopotamia, to take command of the state's military. Time will tell how this near esculation to civil war will lead."

 CAL_TWOWORLDS.1.t:0 "Two Worlds Collide"
 CAL_TWOWORLDS.1.d:0 "Docked at Port Festiva, the naval transport ship USS Golden was offloading a new shipment of supplies bound for central Mewni. As the mewman dock workers scurried about, two Californians stood at the side of the ship near the bridge, looking down below where the wooden docks met the metal hull. Lady Everette, a former US Senator before the collapse of the US and now holding the title of Lady as she served as Norton’s Secretary of State, smirked, "Look at them. Uneducated peasants."\n\n"An unfair assessment, Lady Everette," said recently titled Lord Birnbaum, the CEO of Northwest of California, "That is why we are here. To bring them our help and assistance."\n\n"We are here, Birnbaum, only as traders because of the infinite grace of the Emperor!"\n\n"That and because both the State Assembly and the people support our help to the mewmans," Birnbaum pointed out.\n\n"The ‘Mewmans’ are a backward people. They have ‘magic’ and ‘interdimensional travel’, yet they still use hand cranked cranes and horse drawn carriages. They live in squalor, unlike us Californians!"\n\n"Norton only recently addressed the homeless crisis, you know."\n\n"And by his grace we should do the same of them," she held her hand out at a dock worker who was slowly walking backward from another worker, "Not with token aid, but by our armed forces! Just as we will one day bring liberation to America over the madman Curtis and the rogue Lord Trembley, we shall do the same to Mewni. Our ideals, our prosperity, our democracy, by the grace of Norton!"\n\n"And by the Imperial Governor’s grace, he knows the reality of our situation with Mewni, unlike you dear Lady. As much as they need our industry and food, we need their magical water, their knowledge of magic. That is the only thing keeping California afloat as the rest of the United States burns. They control our interdimensional communications and our ability to traverse dimensions. We lose that and California shall fall too! We are at each other’s mercy, Lady Everette. The first to pull the trigger would simply be the one responsible for both our deaths."\n\nShe rolled her eyes, "For now, Lord Birnbaum. But soon, with Project Golden Gate, all of the multiverse shall be at our beck and call."\n\nBirnbaum shook his head as she walked away."

 CAL_JANNA.1.t:0 "Internship"
 CAL_JANNA.1.d:0 "Hector Diaz-Guzman. Lieutenant Governor of California. A fit yet aging man, the man sat in his chair, staring up at the ceiling and contemplating his life at this moment. He opened his drawer and pulled out a solid metal forearm bracelet. It was adorned with unique engravings of his hispanic roots and the center was a crystal star that radiated a low power resonance. Hector thought of the old life he had and all that had lead up to today. It was then there was a knock on his office door. His secretary was already gone for the day, so he went over to personally open the door to see who it was.\n\n"Sup, DeeGee." Said Janna.\n\nAfter a moment, he recognized her, "Oh hey, you're that kid that torments Marco. What are you doing in Sac-Town?"\n\n"My Parents said to get a summer job and word is you need an aid. Of the subversion sort of task, political brokering, cooresion, investigating. That kind of stuff."\n\n"And a 15 year old girl can do the job of a political strongman?"\n\nJanna chuckled, "You underestimate me. A sample of my work," She handed him a folder, "He doesn't even know."\n\nHector read through the folder, "So you have my grandnephew's SSN and detailed information... oh, so that's his middle name. This is both criminal and not really hard to get, Janna. Just go back to Echo Creek and don't  open a line of credit under Marco's name."\n\nShe seemingly gave up quickly and shrugged her shoulders, "Oh well. If that's what you want. Former Deputy Director Hector Daiz of the Federal Paranormal Investigations!"\n\nHector pulled her into his office and slammed the door. He pulled out his .223 pistol instinctually before reholstering it as it was just a teenage girl. Janna all the while smiled at Hector's provocation. "How do you know that?"\n\n"Better you put my skills to work digging into other people's history than your own. Wouldn't you say?"\n\nHector looked at her straight, "I can have you extracted and unpersoned, Janna Ordonia."\n\nShe matched his glance and pulled out a food container from her backpack, "I brought Lumpia."\n\n"Done!" He grabbed the container and began eating the lumpia, "I'll have you placed on some internship. Come back tomorrow morning and we'll start your training."\n\n"Nice""

 CAL_JANNA.11.t:0 "The Manna Heresy"
 CAL_JANNA.11.d:0 "Through the busy streets of Port Festiva, Star, Marco, and Janna made their way to the Californian Embassy. Passing through the gates and into the building, they walked up to the office of the Imperial Bureau of Investigations. They walked in to be greeted by Marco’s Uncle, Californian Lieutenant Governor Hector Diaz-Guzman. “Oh good, you three are here. Janne, we need to talk,” He said as they all sat down.\n\n“Is this about those Jaggy Royal Court hostages?”\n\n“What hostages? Uhg, never mind that," Hector handed her a folder, “Word from the Forest of Certain Death is that a Death Cult has emerged. And Apparently they worship you as their leader!”\n\nJanna smiled, “That? Oh yeah, I needed a safe house and they offered to accommodate me,” she turned to Marco, “I got a real silver tongue here.”\n\nHe crossed his arms and grumbled, “Still want my $650 back from that Ponzi scheme...”\n\n“Is that bad?” asked Star.\n\n“Heh, probably not,” Hector handed Janna another file, “But I got new intel on them. Her role has escalated to borderline deity. And with that comes some odd shippings by them.”\n\nJanna took look, “There’s a sect called the “Order of Janstar?”\n\n“What?” Star took the file, “They’re shipping you and me?! We got to stop them.”\n\nJanne took the file back and placed her arm around Star, getting very close to her, “Hold on, this could be interesting. We can use this to our advantage.”\n\nHector coughed, “There is also another, uh, competing sect,” He handed her another file.\n\n“Oh, I wonder what that could... The Manna Brotherhood? Oh, ew, no! Not me and Marco.”\n\n“Haha!” laughed Marco.\n\nShe stood up walked to the fireplace and punched a brick. The wall above opened up and a rack of firearms came out. She grabbed a P90 and tossed a Berett .50 Cal to Marco, who was promptly pinned to the ground by its weight. “Star, open a portal. Time to purge some heretics for the Emperor.”\n\nHector walked over in mild annoyance and grabbed the P90, “No Janna. These sects come and go. I won’t authorized use of force.” He placed the weapons back, “Just be careful next time who you interact with. Now go be platonic with each other somewhere else.”"

 CAL_GUSTAV.1.t:0 "The Gustav Kerfuffle"
 CAL_GUSTAV.1.d:0 "On a quiet morning, the doorbell rang at the Diaz Residence.\n\n“I’ll get it!” yelled Star from upstairs.\n\nDownstairs in the kitchen, Marco walked over to the stairs, “Don’t worry Star. I can get it- Ah!”\n\nStar slid down the stair railing, banking a hard left and slamming into Marco. As he laid on the ground, Star stuck the landing and walked over to the front door. “Like I said. I got it!” She opened the door. “Hello...” Her enthusiasm dropped suddenly.\n\n“Hello Star! My fellow exchange student from the land of Mewni!”\n\n“G-Gustav?”\n\nMarco quickly got back up when he heard that name and rushed over to the door, shoving Star aside, “Gustav!”\n\n“Marco, my American friend! How good it is to see you,” they exchanged their long secret handshake as Rafael and Angie rushed over, “Mr and Mrs. Diaz. It is so wonderful to see you, ja?”\n\n“Gustav!”\n\nAs the four of them walked into the living room, conversing about, Star stared at Gustav with distrust."
 CAL_GUSTAV.1.a:0 "“Gustav...”"
 
 CAL_GUSTAV.2.t:0 "Permanent Exchange Student"
 CAL_GUSTAV.2.d:0 "“And there I was, swimming across the Atlantic with a baby seal on my back. I crossed the finish line, set a new world record as fastest swimmer across the Atlantic and reunited that seal with its mother,” he began to shed a tear, Star rolling her eyes, “That was when I heard my beloved homeland of Scandinavia was swept away by the Kerfuffle. The EU Ambassador told me I was the last Scandinavian left on Earth...” He paused as everyone but Star at the dinner table looked on in sadness. He continued, “So I traveled here, to my favorite American Family. I couldn’t even return to Europe. What with, as the Franco-Germans call it, the Third Weltkrieg about to occur and all.”\n\n“You’re safe here with us, Gustav. Mi Casa es Su Casa!” said Rafael.\n\n“And you can rest assured, Gustav,” said Marco’s granduncle Hector as he shoved another meatball into his mouth, “Until the end of the Canadian and Scandinavian Kerfuffle, you are welcome here in the great state of California.”\n\n“Si!” Rafael ate another meatball.\n\n“Oh Diazs, your hospitality warms my cold scandinavian heart!”\n\nStar scoffed at his comment as she poked her meatball, “Yeah, scandinavian...”\n\nHector finished his plate, “I’m going to grab some fresh air. Rafael.”\n\n“Tio Hector.”\n\nThe Lieutenant Governor walked out the back door and leaned against the wall. He took out an e-cigarette and took a puff before taking out his phone. “Now, let’s see what's the status of Project Golden-”"
 CAL_GUSTAV.2.a:0 "Hector!"
 
 CAL_GUSTAV.3.t:0 "A Smoke and Meatballs"
 CAL_GUSTAV.3.d:0 "Hector dropped his phone and cigarette and scrambled to pick it up. He turned to see Star outside with him. “Star, you startled me. Was there something you needed?”\n\n“You used to be a secret spy, right?”\n\n“What I did is classified. You can't prove anything.”\n\n“What? No, I don't care about that. It's about Gustav. I know something Marco and his parents don’t know.”\n\nHector sighed in relief, “Oh that. You realized the twerp isn’t from Scandinavia?”\n\nStar looked at him in bewilderment, “You knew?”\n\n“I don’t need to be a spy to know that. The kid has Bakersfieldville written over him the moment I met him,” he took another puff, “But dang, doesn’t he make a mean meatball? Besides, he’s harmless.”\n\n“But Marco and Mr. and Mrs. Diaz?”\n\n“Rafael and Angie are not... the most observant people. For Marco, I am a bit disappointed in him for not seeing through the Gustav shtick. His grandfather Jaun had a keen eye.”\n\nMarco walked out the door with the trash, “What are you two talking about?”\n\nHector suddenly panicked, “Huh, just diplomatic stuff. Corn trades with Mewni and all.”\n\nStar turned to Hector, “Yeah, uh... Would You Be Interested In A Trade Agreement With Mewni?”\n\nMarco shrugged, tossed the trash and walked back inside. Hector turned to Star, “Leave it alone, Star. If there's one thing Californians can agree on, besides those dang Texans, is that acknowledging Bakersfieldville only leads to trouble...” As he went back inside, he noticed Star’s wand and the split star on it, “Is your wand okay?”\n\n“What, this,” she smiled and nervously laughed it off, “That’s just the newest style. Broken and internally scared,” She then dabbed with her wand and shouted out random pop cultural phrases.\n\nHe continued inside, confused as he rubbed the left forearm of his coat, “I am old...”\n\nOutside, Star contemplated on what to do with “Gustav”."
 CAL_GUSTAV.3.a:0 "“That sad little boy isn’t worth my time.”"
 CAL_GUSTAV.3.b:0 "“Mark my word, he’ll regret coming back here...”"
 
 CAL_GUSTAV.4.t:0 "Star Story"
 CAL_GUSTAV.4.d:0 "Star quickly slides down the stairs while yelling about a new dance that was popular and the new pop song that she had on repeat. Her plan was to be a distraction for Marco and his parents while the laser puppies she unleashed outside set stuffon fire in the backyard so she could have a direct conversation while “Gustav”.\n\nThe plan went accordingly and the Diazs rushed out to the backyard trying to prevent more fires and put out all the ones the laser puppies had created, leaving “Gustav” on his own in the living room.\n\nStar quickly aimed her wand and yelled out to him “Hello, Charles Booth! Now please explain to me why in Corn’s name you’re back here instead of in that depressing town of yours. I know you most likely want something and I’m here to prevent it!”\n\nCharles sighed and asked Star, speaking in his regular Bakerfieldvillian voice “What do you want this time to convince you I’m not here to murder the Diaz family or something like that?”\n\n“I want you out of this house and to never come back!” She demands loudly.\n\n“Well I’m not doing that so you better get used to dealing with me. Even as our own nation, California still ignores my hometown. But with the Kerfuffle? This is my chance to fix that. And don’t try to stop me. I mean you didn’t expose me the first time. Poor Rafael, Angie, and Marco would be devastated that you didn’t tell them the truth,” He coughed and spoke again with his scandinavian accent “We are stuck together, ja? Like you Americans call it, you are Woody and I am the Buzz of Lightyear, no?”\n\nStar groaned."
 CAL_GUSTAV.4.a:0 "“You most certainly don’t have a friend in me!”"
 
 CAL_GUSTAV.5.t:0 "Multi Level Meatball"
 CAL_GUSTAV.5.d:0 "“Hej Diaz Family. Jag har a big favor to ask of you three,” The Diazs and Gustav were in the living room, “I am planning on opening up my very own restaurang or as you Americans call it, restaurant here in Echo Creek. It will be off of my world famous meatballs. I’m still deciding on names but it would either be Gustavs köttbullsemporium or Gustavs kjøttkakeremporium” he said through a strange mix of a Swedish and a Norwegian accent.\n\nAngie Diaz quickly asked him about more details sounding incredibly excited before she finally said on a quick pace “Oh my goodness. Yes Gustav we would love to invest into your amazing danish dishes. Take all of our money. I have full faith within you to make this worth it.”\n\nRaefael and Marco nodded their heads in agreement. All of them could be heard spouting some random business words like “ownership percentages” and “mortgages” which sounded like fictional languages to Star who had listened into the conversation from the stairs.\n\nStar aimed her wand forward whispering some words to a cupcake explosion spell before she aimed the wand to the floor as she started to plan to expose him to the entire family that he was in fact some loser from Bakersfieldville. She spent one last moment, holding the explosive cupcake to think about whether to do so. Then she bolted towards the Diaz family panting and through her panting yelled out."
 CAL_GUSTAV.5.a:0 "“Stop! He’s no true Scandinavian! Don’t invest”"
 CAL_GUSTAV.5.b:0 "“Gutsav’s idea... is brilliant! I think you should invest!”"
 
 CAL_GUSTAV.6.t:0 "Baking in Bakersfieldville"
 CAL_GUSTAV.6.d:0 "With Star’s intervention, the talk of investing into “Gustav's” restaurant fell through. But what she didn’t expect was Charles quickly turning the situation around on Star about how she never told the Diazs about him and used his sad Bakerfieldvillian puppy face to still gain sympathy. Star was shocked as they agreed to help Charles’ idea to bring happiness with a restaurant in Bakersfieldville itself.\n\nIn no time at all, Star stood in front of Gustav’s restaurant in Bakersfieldville. The tables inside and out were full with both happy locals and out-of-towners. With the skills he gained from his multiple foreigh exchange student personas, his restaurant had a wide range of food and garnished popularity across the state. As News Channels from San Francisco and Los Angeles were interviewing him, Star and Hector were at the side lines.\n\n“Star. What did I tell you not to do?” he said, horrified at the entire sight.\n\n“Not to involve Bakersfieldvillie... But I stopped him from taking your family’s money!”\n\n“Rafael is an artist and Angie is a stay at home mother. I bought their house for them as a wedding gift. Even Marco has more money than them! But now all the attention is here. Everyone in the state feels bad for him and this sad city.”\n\nLady Everett walked in, “And the political chaos it causes is great. The state representatives for the city just introduced a bill to “solve” North and South tensions... by moving the state capital here!”\n\n“¡Dios mío! And the polling?”\n\n“90%! If we order the assembly to vote it down now, the government will collapse. Norton has to sign it now!” She turned to Star, “And you, Princess Star. Your mother will hear about this in the next series of trade negotiations!”\n\nAs Everett walked off, Hector broke down to his knees and started crying. Then he took out his to-go tray of meatballs and began eating them as he cried, “I don’t want to work here...these things are good.”\n\nStar groaned at the whole situation as Charles walked over to her, “Gotta say Star. If it wasn’t for you. None of this would be possible! I and Bakersfilend owe you our thanks.”\n\nShe aimed her wand at him."
 CAL_GUSTAV.6.a:0 "“Narwhal Blast”"
 
 CAL_GUSTAV.7.t:0 "Sunny with a Chance of Meatballs"
 CAL_GUSTAV.7.d:0 "Eager to invest with Star’s support, the Diazs were quick to agree. They gave most of their money, which actually wasn't a lot given their occupation. Nonetheless, it took no time to open a new restaurant in downtown Echo Creek due to the economic downturn and to raving fanfare. With “Gustav” as the owner, the restaurant had several chefs of different nationalities to give a world-wide menu. All of them were just different personas of Charles, from his french cuisine, italian cooking, to soul food and asian fusion.\n\nHector took a bite of his chowmein, “Heh, Thai Go does it better.”\n\n“This is good fried chicken though,” said Janna.\n\nStar took a bite of Gustav’s meatballs and was pleasantly surprised, “These are pretty good actually.”\n\n“By the way. Thank you Star for not doing anything rash with our friend “Gustav” here. The less we have to talk about Bakersfieldville, the better.”\n\nGustav came over to their table, “Star, Governor, girl who scares me, it is good you came to my restaurang, ja?” He placed down another plate of meatballs, “Please, eat to your heart's content.”\n\nHector nodded, “We certainly will,” He then grabbed him by the collar and pulled him in, “And I expect you to pay back my nephew every cent he invested into you. Or you’ll be going back to that sad sack city you call “Scandinavia” in a body bag. Understood?!”\n\nGustav voice cracked and he barely responded in his normal voice, “Y-Y-Yes Mr. Diaz- Lieutenant Governor Diaz-Guzman!”\n\nHe quickly scurried away. The two girls smiled. All three of them forked a meatball and toasted with it."
