 CAL_STARTER.2.d:0 "With news of the dissolve of congress, followed by an uncermonial return of California's nearly 75 representives and two senators, Governor Green has called an emergency meeting in Portland. As National Guard forces are called up, Green annouced that, in cooridnation with Oregon and Washington, that the western US will no longer acknowledge D.C. and the Curtis Adminstartion as the legitmate Federal Government.\n\nAlready, US forces in the state have sworn loyalty to California as word now spreads that Green has asked the retired General Sherman Pines, the Hero of Mesopotamia, to take command of the state's military. Time will tell how this near esculation to civil war will lead."

 CAL_TWOWORLDS.1.t:0 "Two Worlds Collide"
 CAL_TWOWORLDS.1.d:0 "Docked at Port Festiva, the naval transport ship USS Golden was offloading a new shipment of supplies bound for central Mewni. As the mewman dock workers scurried about, two Californians stood at the side of the ship near the bridge, looking down below where the wooden docks met the metal hull. Lady Everette, a former US Senator before the collapse of the US and now holding the title of Lady as she served as Norton’s Secretary of State, smirked, "Look at them. Uneducated peasants."\n\n"An unfair assessment, Lady Everette," said recently titled Lord Birnbaum, the CEO of Northwest of California, "That is why we are here. To bring them our help and assistance."\n\n"We are here, Birnbaum, only as traders because of the infinite grace of the Emperor!"\n\n"That and because both the State Assembly and the people support our help to the mewmans," Birnbaum pointed out.\n\n"The ‘Mewmans’ are a backward people. They have ‘magic’ and ‘interdimensional travel’, yet they still use hand cranked cranes and horse drawn carriages. They live in squalor, unlike us Californians!"\n\n"Norton only recently addressed the homeless crisis, you know."\n\n"And by his grace we should do the same of them," she held her hand out at a dock worker who was slowly walking backward from another worker, "Not with token aid, but by our armed forces! Just as we will one day bring liberation to America over the madman Curtis and the rogue Lord Trembley, we shall do the same to Mewni. Our ideals, our prosperity, our democracy, by the grace of Norton!"\n\n"And by the Imperial Governor’s grace, he knows the reality of our situation with Mewni, unlike you dear Lady. As much as they need our industry and food, we need their magical water, their knowledge of magic. That is the only thing keeping California afloat as the rest of the United States burns. They control our interdimensional communications and our ability to traverse dimensions. We lose that and California shall fall too! We are at each other’s mercy, Lady Everette. The first to pull the trigger would simply be the one responsible for both our deaths."\n\nShe rolled her eyes, "For now, Lord Birnbaum. But soon, with Project Golden Gate, all of the multiverse shall be at our beck and call."\n\nBirnbaum shook his head as she walked away."

 CAL_JANNA.1.t:0 "Internship"
 CAL_JANNA.1.d:0 "Hector Diaz-Guzman. Lieutenant Governor of California. A fit yet aging man, the man sat in his chair, staring up at the ceiling and contemplating his life at this moment. He opened his drawer and pulled out a solid metal forearm bracelet. It was adorned with unique engravings of his hispanic roots and the center was a crystal star that radiated a low power resonance. Hector thought of the old life he had and all that had lead up to today. It was then there was a knock on his office door. His secretary was already gone for the day, so he went over to personally open the door to see who it was.\n\n"Sup, DeeGee." Said Janna.\n\nAfter a moment, he recognized her, "Oh hey, you're that kid that torments Marco. What are you doing in Sac-Town?"\n\n"My Parents said to get a summer job and word is you need an aid. Of the subversion sort of task, political brokering, cooresion, investigating. That kind of stuff."\n\n"And a 15 year old girl can do the job of a political strongman?"\n\nJanna chuckled, "You underestimate me. A sample of my work," She handed him a folder, "He doesn't even know."\n\nHector read through the folder, "So you have my grandnephew's SSN and detailed information... oh, so that's his middle name. This is both criminal and not really hard to get, Janna. Just go back to Echo Creek and don't  open a line of credit under Marco's name."\n\nShe seemingly gave up quickly and shrugged her shoulders, "Oh well. If that's what you want. Former Deputy Director Hector Daiz of the Federal Paranormal Investigations!"\n\nHector pulled her into his office and slammed the door. He pulled out his .223 pistol instinctually before reholstering it as it was just a teenage girl. Janna all the while smiled at Hector's provocation. "How do you know that?"\n\n"Better you put my skills to work digging into other people's history than your own. Wouldn't you say?"\n\nHector looked at her straight, "I can have you extracted and unpersoned, Janna Ordonia."\n\nShe matched his glance and pulled out a food container from her backpack, "I brought Lumpia."\n\n"Done!" He grabbed the container and began eating the lumpia, "I'll have you placed on some internship. Come back tomorrow morning and we'll start your training."\n\n"Nice""

 CAL_GUSTAV.1.t:0 "The Gustav Kerfuffle"
 CAL_GUSTAV.1.d:0 "On a quiet morning, the doorbell rang at the Diaz Residence.\n\n“I’ll get it!” yelled Star from upstairs.\n\nDownstairs in the kitchen, Marco walked over to the stairs, “Don’t worry Star. I can get it- Ah!”\n\nStar slid down the stair railing, banking a hard left and slamming into Marco. As he laid on the ground, Star stuck the landing and walked over to the front door. “Like I said. I got it!” She opened the door. “Hello...” Her enthusiasm dropped suddenly.\n\n“Hello Star! My fellow exchange student from the land of Mewni!”\n\n“G-Gustav?”\n\nMarco quickly got back up when he heard that name and rushed over to the door, shoving Star aside, “Gustav!”\n\n“Marco, my American friend! How good it is to see you,” they exchanged their long secret handshake as Rafael and Angie rushed over, “Mr and Mrs. Diaz. It is so wonderful to see you, ja?”\n\n“Gustav!”\n\nAs the four of them walked into the living room, conversing about, Star stared at Gustav with distrust."
 CAL_GUSTAV.1.a:0 "“Gustav...”"
 
 CAL_GUSTAV.2.t:0 "Permanent Exchange Student"
 CAL_GUSTAV.2.d:0 "“And there I was, swimming across the Atlantic with a baby seal on my back. I crossed the finish line, set a new world record as fastest swimmer across the Atlantic and reunited that seal with its mother,” he began to shed a tear, Star rolling her eyes, “That was when I heard my beloved homeland of Scandinavia was swept away by the Kerfuffle. The EU Ambassador told me I was the last Scandinavian left on Earth...” He paused as everyone but Star at the dinner table looked on in sadness. He continued, “So I traveled here, to my favorite American Family. I couldn’t even return to Europe. What with, as the Franco-Germans call it, the Third Weltkrieg about to occur and all.”\n\n“You’re safe here with us, Gustav. Mi Casa es Su Casa!” said Rafael.\n\n“And you can rest assured, Gustav,” said Marco’s granduncle Hector as he shoved another meatball into his mouth, “Until the end of the Canadian and Scandinavian Kerfuffle, you are welcome here in the great state of California.”\n\n“Si!” Rafael ate another meatball.\n\n“Oh Diazs, your hospitality warms my cold scandinavian heart!”\n\nStar scoffed at his comment as she poked her meatball, “Yeah, scandinavian...”\n\nHector finished his plate, “I’m going to grab some fresh air. Rafael.”\n\n“Tio Hector.”\n\nThe Lieutenant Governor walked out the back door and leaned against the wall. He took out an e-cigarette and took a puff before taking out his phone. “Now, let’s see what's the status of Project Golden-”"
 CAL_GUSTAV.2.a:0 "Hector!"
 
 CAL_GUSTAV.3.t:0 "A Smoke and Meatballs"
 CAL_GUSTAV.3.d:0 "Hector dropped his phone and cigarette and scrambled to pick it up. He turned to see Star outside with him. “Star, you startled me. Was there something you needed?”\n\n“You used to be a secret spy, right?”\n\n“What I did is classified. You can't prove anything.”\n\n“What? No, I don't care about that. It's about Gustav. I know something Marco and his parents don’t know.”\n\nHector sighed in relief, “Oh that. You realized the twerp isn’t from Scandinavia?”\n\nStar looked at him in bewilderment, “You knew?”\n\n“I don’t need to be a spy to know that. The kid has Bakersfieldville written over him the moment I met him,” he took another puff, “But dang, doesn’t he make a mean meatball? Besides, he’s harmless.”\n\n“But Marco and Mr. and Mrs. Diaz?”\n\n“Rafael and Angie are not... the most observant people. For Marco, I am a bit disappointed in him for not seeing through the Gustav shtick. His grandfather Jaun had a keen eye.”\n\nMarco walked out the door with the trash, “What are you two talking about?”\n\nHector suddenly panicked, “Huh, just diplomatic stuff. Corn trades with Mewni and all.”\n\nStar turned to Hector, “Yeah, uh... Would You Be Interested In A Trade Agreement With Mewni?”\n\nMarco shrugged, tossed the trash and walked back inside. Hector turned to Star, “Leave it alone, Star. If there's one thing Californians can agree on, besides those dang Texans, is that acknowledging Bakersfieldville only leads to trouble...” As he went back inside, he noticed Star’s wand and the split star on it, “Is your wand okay?”\n\n“What, this,” she smiled and nervously laughed it off, “That’s just the newest style. Broken and internally scared,” She then dabbed with her wand and shouted out random pop cultural phrases.\n\nHe continued inside, confused as he rubbed the left forearm of his coat, “I am old...”\n\nOutside, Star contemplated on what to do with “Gustav”."
 CAL_GUSTAV.3.a:0 "“That sad little boy isn’t worth my time.”"
 CAL_GUSTAV.3.b:0 "“Mark my word, he’ll regret coming back here...”"

 CAL_NWB.1.t:0 "The REC and Northwest Corp"
 CAL_NWB.1.d:0 "REC has defaulted, causing a collapse of the mewni economy. While our economy is overall insulated from them, a ruined Mewni means we will lose critical reosurce like Mewni Magical Water and their Magic Research! Right now, Governor Norton and Lt. Governor Guzman are debating on what to do. Norton contemplates as Guzman makes a phone call. Shall we forgive the debt and restore the economy for Mewni? Can we, California, the richest state in the Union, with a GDP nearly eqaul to the half of the entire Imperial Commonwealth, only outclassed by the European superpowers of Franco-Germany or Polish-Lithuania, spare the $650 needed to bail Mewni of its debt?"
 CAL_NWB.1.a:0 "Norton: Solaria and Jushtin would never have let this happen!"
