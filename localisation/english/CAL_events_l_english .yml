 CAL_STARTER.2.d:0 "With news of the dissolve of congress, followed by an uncermonial return of California's nearly 75 representives and two senators, Governor Green has called an emergency meeting in Portland. As National Guard forces are called up, Green annouced that, in cooridnation with Oregon and Washington, that the western US will no longer acknowledge D.C. and the Curtis Adminstartion as the legitmate Federal Government.\n\nAlready, US forces in the state have sworn loyalty to California as word now spreads that Green has asked the retired General Sherman Pines, the Hero of Mesopotamia, to take command of the state's military. Time will tell how this near esculation to civil war will lead."

 CAL_TWOWORLDS.1.t:0 "Two Worlds Collide" 
 CAL_TWOWORLDS.1.d:0 "Docked at Port Festiva, the naval transport ship USS Golden was offloading a new shipment of supplies bound for central Mewni. As the mewman dock workers scurried about, two Californians stood at the side of the ship near the bridge, looking down below where the wooden docks met the metal hull. Lady Everette, a former US Senator before the collapse of the US and now holding the title of Lady as she served as Norton’s Secretary of State, smirked, "Look at them. Uneducated peasants."\n\n"An unfair assessment, Lady Everette," said recently titled Lord Birnbaum, the CEO of Northwest of California, "That is why we are here. To bring them our help and assistance."\n\n"We are here, Birnbaum, only as traders because of the infinite grace of the Emperor!"\n\n"That and because both the State Assembly and the people support our help to the mewmans," Birnbaum pointed out.\n\n"The ‘Mewmans’ are a backward people. They have ‘magic’ and ‘interdimensional travel’, yet they still use hand cranked cranes and horse drawn carriages. They live in squalor, unlike us Californians!"\n\n"Norton only recently addressed the homeless crisis, you know."\n\n"And by his grace we should do the same of them," she held her hand out at a dock worker who was slowly walking backward from another worker, "Not with token aid, but by our armed forces! Just as we will one day bring liberation to America over the madman Curtis and the rogue Lord Trembley, we shall do the same to Mewni. Our ideals, our prosperity, our democracy, by the grace of Norton!"\n\n"And by the Imperial Governor’s grace, he knows the reality of our situation with Mewni, unlike you dear Lady. As much as they need our industry and food, we need their magical water, their knowledge of magic. That is the only thing keeping California afloat as the rest of the United States burns. They control our interdimensional communications and our ability to traverse dimensions. We lose that and California shall fall too! We are at each other’s mercy, Lady Everette. The first to pull the trigger would simply be the one responsible for both our deaths."\n\nShe rolled her eyes, "For now, Lord Birnbaum. But soon, with Project Golden Gate, all of the multiverse shall be at our beck and call."\n\nBirnbaum shook his head as she walked away."

 CAL_birnbaum_event.1.t:0 "Utah Joines the Imperial Republic!"
 CAL_birnbaum_event.1.d:0 "As we finish up negotiations with the State of Utah to join our Imperial United States, the governor of Utah has revealed that they have access to a special well with holy properties. To our amazement, the Great Salt Lake is home to an inter-dimensional well to the Realm of Magic, a special interconnecting dimension to everywhere else in our plan of reality! More importantly, it gives us access to that rare Magical Water, normally found only on Mewni.\n\nA deal has been proposed, separate of the main negotiations. If we invest into Utah, they’ll be willing to let us trade for it. But if we invest a large amount of capital both financial and political right now, they’ll exclusivity sell to us. We need access to the water for sure, but should we secure it now or worry of trade later?"
 CAL_birnbaum_event.1.a:0 "They have a Deal!"
 CAL_birnbaum_event.1.b:0 "Just make sure we can come back to this later..."
 
 CAL_birnbaum_event.2.t:0 "Arizona Joines the Imperial Republic!"
 CAL_birnbaum_event.2.d:0 "Arizona is asking the Imperial Government for help. There is currently a migrant crisis at the border with Mexico. We had assume its those fleeing South America in the wake of the now global kerfuffle, but that part of the world has been unusually stable and quiet. Actually, we have no idea what’s happening in South America. The people trying to cross over are actually Americans from the East Coast, fleeing President Curtis!\n\nOddly enough, none of them wanted to flee to California’s relativity open border, choosing Arizona instead. Arizona now ask we take custody of them and house them in California. But since Curtis won the Eastern States by a massive margin last election, many Californians are not so charitable to their eastern brethren. Arizona does promise close cooperation with the Imperial Government if we help, and the opposite if they don’t."
 CAL_birnbaum_event.2.a:0 "Send to them to California"
 CAL_birnbaum_event.2.b:0 "Sends some fund to keep them in Arizona"
 
 CAL_birnbaum_event.3.t:0 "Colorado Joines the Imperial Republic!"
 CAL_birnbaum_event.3.d:0 "With the Rocky Mountain cutting right through the middle of the state, Colorado is both the Gateway to the West and a fortress anyone east must take to enter it. With potentially hostile states from the Eastern Government and the Trembley Government bordering it, Colorado is asking California to defend the front line of a divided America.\n\nWe can invest resources to fortify the state, with the goal of eventually using it as a staging ground to one day march East towards the Mississippi. While popular, that would be expensive. We could just set up some light defenses, but neither our or their populace will like this."
 CAL_birnbaum_event.3.a:0 "Like Hannibal before, Norton will one day ride down the Rockies!"
 CAL_birnbaum_event.3.b:0 "Just shore up some defenses there."
 
 CAL_birnbaum_event.4.t:0 "New Mexico Joines the Imperial Republic!"
 CAL_birnbaum_event.4.d:0 "New Mexico is home to the original site of Los Alamos, where the first atomic bomb was developed. As SDI, EuroNet, and the Northern Lights systems render nuclear warfare as a whole impossible (on Earth), the site is still an active facility into both peaceful and non-peaceful research into the atom. One we could make good use of, in case something in the multiverse needs a nuke up the butt. Some one also mentioned Roswell and aliens, but Lieutenant Governor Diaz-Guzman laughed it off, citing the teenage alien joyriders that crashed there are either long dead or too high up in the old Federal Government to be touched.\n\nFor a lump sum payment, New Mexico will gladly hand the facilities to the Imperial Government and even wave the cost they incurred keeping it from irradiating the entire South West. We could also just take it, as we are the successor government to the old Federal Government, but they won’t be happy about that and the scientist will be less enthusiastic to work for us."
 CAL_birnbaum_event.4.a:0 "A fair enough deal."
 CAL_birnbaum_event.4.b:0 "Give us back rightful Imperial Property!"
 
 CAL_birnbaum_event.5.t:0 "Protector Of Mexico"
 CAL_birnbaum_event.5.d:0 "Similar to Arizona, there has been a refugee crisis of Eastern Americans heading to Mexico by sailing from Florida, then traveling up to the border. Apparently the Texan-Federal Border is that well guarded. This has cause major issues with the independent Republic of Texas and the United Mexican States. We can’t risk a war occurring in the Southwest when we need troops either in the Northwest or Mewni, so we have offered to intervene. With it, Emperor Norton has declared he will reinstate is old title of “The Protector of Mexico”, one he initially relinquished after France invaded Mexico centuries ago.\n\nThe Texans are not friendly to us Californians, but they are a rational folk. We can send Birnbaum in to use Northwest of Texas to open negotiations and find a solution to this crisis. Or we can outright demand they back off, as the might of California and its allied states can take on Texas.\n\nSome politicians think this is a bad mistake all around, but if we back off now, we will look weak to the entire country and disgrace Norton a second time around!"

 CAL_NWB.1.t:0 "The REC and Northwest Corp"
 CAL_NWB.1.d:0 "REC has defaulted, causing a collapse of the mewni economy. While our economy is overall insulated from them, a ruined Mewni means we will lose critical reosurce like Mewni Magical Water and their Magic Research! Right now, Governor Norton and Lt. Governor Guzman are debating on what to do. Norton contemplates as Guzman makes a phone call. Shall we forgive the debt and restore the economy for Mewni? Can we, California, the richest state in the Union, with a GDP nearly eqaul to the half of the entire Imperial Commonwealth, only outclassed by the European superpowers of Franco-Germany or Polish-Lithuania, spare the $650 needed to bail Mewni of its debt?"

 CAL_TEST.1.t:0 "A Stranger's War in a Strange Land"
 CAL_TEST.1.d:0 "As we sat in exile on the Diaz's couch from our home, the consequences of our defeat has followed us to Earth. Their Emperor Norton's defeat alongside us has broken California. Already, the young Marco's granduncle, Regent Lieutenant Governor Hector Diaz-Guzman, is rallying forces loyal to him to overthrow the Imperial Governor and word is spreading this Lord President Trembley will side with them. But many still stand with Emperor Norton.\n\nWith most of our army still with us, camping in the Diaz's backyard, we have a choice. Stay with Southern California and hope one day Diaz and Trembley would help us reclaim our land? Or side with Norton, who is unlikley to win but eager to help us reclaim Mewni as soon as possible?"
 CAL_TEST.1.a:0 "Butterflys Side with Winners. How fortunate your human friend is one of them?"
 CAL_TEST.1.b:0 ""We must bide our time. No need to fight a stranger's war.""

 CAL_CEF.0.t:0 "The Mewmans Request Economic Aid"
 CAL_CEF.0.d:0 "The Kingdom of Mewni, the extradimensional kingdom we have made contact with, has requested that we send them some economic aid. Apparently they are going through some sort of food shortage, and due to them being an agrarian pre-industrial society this spells disaster for them.\n\nIf we were to send them some aid, we would ask for some territory in return. This would make us an interdimensional state, the first of it's kind coming from earth. On the other hand, if we were to reject them and withold aid, our analysts predict that the Kingdom of Mewni would not completely collapse. It would go through some instability and harship, sure, but the Butterfly monarchy would stay in power."

 CAL_CEF.1.t:0 "Californians Want Territory as Payment!"
 CAL_CEF.1.d:0 "Our request to California has returned with a response: They will provide us with aid, if we provide them with some territory. Specifically, the territory of the Waterway Overlook.\n\nBy accepting and taking their aid, we can be more lax on the people and accelerate out industrial development. However, by giving the Californians a foothold in our dimension it opens the door for them to exert more influence over the dimension and, by extension, us. With their industrial and technological advantage over us, we would be at a disadvantage when dealing with them. Should we ever get on their bad side..."
