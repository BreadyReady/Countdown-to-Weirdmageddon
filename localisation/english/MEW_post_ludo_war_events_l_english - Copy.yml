ludo_surrender.4.t:0 "The Death of Toffee"
ludo_surrender.4.d:0 ""Toffee."\n\nToffee looked up at Moon. He was chained up. They were outside on some gallows, a cheering crowd before them. "Moon."\n\n"So, after all these years, we meet again. Tell me, do you think this is how you would die?"\n\n"I would have prefered to die old. But this end was predictable." He looked out over the crowd. "Atleast I didn't get kicked into the void of space like Ludo did. Tell me, Moon, why did you let him go into exile while you captured me for execution?"\n\n"...The same reason i'm here in front of you, instead of looking at you from a distance." Moon's hand tightened into a fist. "You killed my mother. I want you dead. I want to see it with my own eyes."\n\n"Revenge. How poetic..." Toffee looked to the executioner, who was approaching him. "Ah, destiny calls. Will you be reading out a statement, or will you just be watching from now on?"\n\n"I'll just be watching. I don't think I can read all your crimes without choking up. Good day." Moon took a few steps back and let the formalities pass. She blocked most of it out, she was mainly focused on Toffee.\n\nThe sack was thrown over his head. The noose was tied tight around his neck. And after a final deliberation, the trapdoor was opened from under him.\n\nMoon watched as he struggled, and slowly watched the life leave his body. She felt a sharp pain in her arm, but she kept her composure. After Toffee's body lie still for a while, she whispered something with a smile."

eclipsa.1.t:0 "Stranger In The Royal Garden"
eclipsa.1.d:0 "Moon was striding happily towards the royal rose garden. Her spirits were lifted after watching Toffee die. But as she slowly opened the door outside, she saw something.\n\n"You know, once in a while, you've got to slow down and appreciate the feeling of a nice head scratch, or the smell of a freshly bloomed rose, or the taste of a delicious candy bar."\n\nMoon's eyes widened as she realized who it was. Eclipsa Butterfly, someone who was incased in crystal for 300 years, was talking to her very own daughter Star! As the memories of her making a deal with Eclipsa came flooding back, she felt a hand on her shoulder. It was a Knight.\n\n"Your majesty, we've got the garden surrounded. But we could use some help."\n\nBack in the garden, Star had quickly warmed up to Eclipsa. She had no idea who she was talking to. "Hey, if you're around tonight, you should come to the royal dinner."\n\n"Oh, that sounds delightful. But I may have other plans."\n\n"Aw. You got a hot date?"\n\n"Something like that-" All of a sudden Moon, the Magic High Commision, and some knights bust down the doors surrounding them.\n\n"Star!"\n\n"Mom!" Star ducked as Eclipsa was quickly pinned against the wall and incapacitated."What the heck is going on!?"\n\n"Star, are you okay? Did she hurt you?" Moon ran up to her.\n\n "What? No. No one hurt me. I was just talking to that nice lady."\n\n"Nice lady? Star, that's Eclipsa."\n\nAfter taking the the nessecary precautions of chaining Eclipsa up in the dungeon, Moon had some time to think. She decided to keep Eclipsa's return a secret to the public, she could not risk people wanting her on the throne."
