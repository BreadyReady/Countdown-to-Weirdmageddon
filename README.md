# Countdown-to-Weirdmageddon
This is the repository for the mod Countdown to Weirdmageddon

Countdown to Weirdmageddon is a total conversion mod for HoI4 that crosses over four popular Disney shows in a clash of interdimensional proportions.
Anchored around Earth 42’\, CtW follows the story of Gravity Falls, SvTFoE, Amphibia, and The Owl House, giving the player the ability to play
and experience a story close to the show’s story, or branch out with interesting what-ifs within the world of the shows.
All the while, the multiverse around them can bring the dimensions together, opening the worlds to interdimensional conquest
or an event of total multiversal destruction.
The Countdown to Weirdmageddon has begun!
